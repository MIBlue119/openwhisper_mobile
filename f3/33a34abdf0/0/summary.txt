Typecheck passes. Here's the summary:

**Why you see no models:** The `useWhisperKit` hook detects that the WhisperKit native module isn't loaded in the runtime, so it skips calling `getAvailableModels()`. The `availableModels` stays as `[]`, and the `ModelPicker` had no empty/error state UI.

**What I fixed:**
1. `settings.tsx` — Now passes the `error` from `useWhisperKit()` to `ModelPicker`
2. `ModelPicker.tsx` — Shows a warning message when there's an error, and a loading spinner when models are being fetched

**To get WhisperKit models working**, you need to do a full native rebuild (not just a Metro reload):

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

This recompiles the native binary with the WhisperKitModule included. After that, the model list should populate.

Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind.\"\n\nDo not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.\n\n### 0. Idea Refinement\n\n**Check for brainstorm output first:**\n\nBefore asking questions, look for recent brainstorm documents in `docs/brainstorms/` that match this feature:\n\n```bash\nls -la docs/brainstorms/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10\n```\n\n**Relevance criteria:** A brainstorm is relevant if:\n- The topic (from filename or YAML frontmatter) semantically matches the feature description\n- Created within the last 14 days\n- If multiple candidates match, use the most recent one\n\n**If a relevant brainstorm exists:**\n1. Read the brainstorm document\n2. Announce: \"Found brainstorm from [date]: [topic]. Using as context for planning.\"\n3. Extract key decisions, chosen approach, and open questions\n4. **Skip the idea refinement questions below** - the brainstorm already answered WHAT to build\n5. Use brainstorm decisions as input to the research phase\n\n**If multiple brainstorms could match:**\nUse **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask which brainstorm to use, or whether to proceed without one.\n\n**If no brainstorm found (or not relevant), run idea refinement:**\n\nRefine the idea through collaborative dialogue using the **AskUserQuestion tool**:\n\n- Ask questions one at a time to understand the idea fully\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when natural options exist\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints and success criteria\n- Continue until the idea is clear OR user says \"proceed\"\n\n**Gather signals for research decision.** During refinement, note:\n\n- **User's familiarity**: Do they know the codebase patterns? Are they pointing to examples?\n- **User's intent**: Speed vs thoroughness? Exploration vs execution?\n- **Topic risk**: Security, payments, external APIs warrant more caution\n- **Uncertainty level**: Is the approach clear or open-ended?\n\n**Skip option:** If the feature description is already detailed, offer:\n\"Your description is clear. Should I proceed with research, or would you like to refine it further?\"\n\n## Main Tasks\n\n### 1. Local Research (Always Runs - Parallel)\n\n<thinking>\nFirst, I need to understand the project's conventions, existing patterns, and any documented learnings. This is fast and local - it informs whether external research is needed.\n</thinking>\n\nRun these agents **in parallel** to gather local context:\n\n- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)\n- Task learnings-researcher(feature_description)\n\n**What to look for:**\n- **Repo research:** existing patterns, CLAUDE.md guidance, technology familiarity, pattern consistency\n- **Learnings:** documented solutions in `docs/solutions/` that might apply (gotchas, patterns, lessons learned)\n\nThese findings inform the next step.\n\n### 1.5. Research Decision\n\nBased on signals from Step 0 and findings from Step 1, decide on external research.\n\n**High-risk topics → always research.** Security, payments, external APIs, data privacy. The cost of missing something is too high. This takes precedence over speed signals.\n\n**Strong local context → skip external research.** Codebase has good patterns, CLAUDE.md has guidance, user knows what they want. External research adds little value.\n\n**Uncertainty or unfamiliar territory → research.** User is exploring, codebase has no examples, new technology. External perspective is valuable.\n\n**Announce the decision and proceed.** Brief explanation, then continue. User can redirect if needed.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Your codebase has solid patterns for this. Proceeding without external research.\"\n- \"This involves payment processing, so I'll research current best practices first.\"\n\n### 1.5b. External Research (Conditional)\n\n**Only run if Step 1.5 indicates external research is valuable.**\n\nRun these agents in parallel:\n\n- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)\n- Task framework-docs-researcher(feature_description)\n\n### 1.6. Consolidate Research\n\nAfter all research steps complete, consolidate findings:\n\n- Document relevant file paths from repo research (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)\n- **Include relevant institutional learnings** from `docs/solutions/` (key insights, gotchas to avoid)\n- Note external documentation URLs and best practices (if external research was done)\n- List related issues or PRs discovered\n- Capture CLAUDE.md conventions\n\n**Optional validation:** Briefly summarize findings and ask if anything looks off or missing before proceeding to planning.\n\n### 2. Issue Planning & Structure\n\n<thinking>\nThink like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives\n</thinking>\n\n**Title & Categorization:**\n\n- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`, `fix: Cart total calculation`)\n- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor\n- [ ] Convert title to filename: add today's date prefix, strip prefix colon, kebab-case, add `-plan` suffix\n  - Example: `feat: Add User Authentication` → `2026-01-21-feat-add-user-authentication-plan.md`\n  - Keep it descriptive (3-5 words after prefix) so plans are findable by context\n\n**Stakeholder Analysis:**\n\n- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)\n- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise\n\n**Content Planning:**\n\n- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience\n- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template\n- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)\n- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists\n\n### 3. SpecFlow Analysis\n\nAfter planning the issue structure, run SpecFlow Analyzer to validate and refine the feature specification:\n\n- Task spec-flow-analyzer(feature_description, research_findings)\n\n**SpecFlow Analyzer Output:**\n\n- [ ] Review SpecFlow analysis results\n- [ ] Incorporate any identified gaps or edge cases into the issue\n- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on SpecFlow findings\n\n### 4. Choose Implementation Detail Level\n\nSelect how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.\n\n#### 📄 MINIMAL (Quick Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Simple bugs, small improvements, clear features\n\n**Includes:**\n\n- Problem statement or feature description\n- Basic acceptance criteria\n- Essential context only\n\n**Structure:**\n\n````markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n[Brief problem/feature description]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Core requirement 1\n- [ ] Core requirement 2\n\n## Context\n\n[Any critical information]\n\n## MVP\n\n### test.rb\n\n```ruby\nclass Test\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"test\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Related issue: #[issue_number]\n- Documentation: [relevant_docs_url]\n````\n\n#### 📋 MORE (Standard Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Most features, complex bugs, team collaboration\n\n**Includes everything from MINIMAL plus:**\n\n- Detailed background and motivation\n- Technical considerations\n- Success metrics\n- Dependencies and risks\n- Basic implementation suggestions\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n## Overview\n\n[Comprehensive description]\n\n## Problem Statement / Motivation\n\n[Why this matters]\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n[High-level approach]\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Architecture impacts\n- Performance implications\n- Security considerations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Detailed requirement 1\n- [ ] Detailed requirement 2\n- [ ] Testing requirements\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n[How we measure success]\n\n## Dependencies & Risks\n\n[What could block or complicate this]\n\n## References & Research\n\n- Similar implementations: [file_path:line_number]\n- Best practices: [documentation_url]\n- Related PRs: #[pr_number]\n```\n\n#### 📚 A LOT (Comprehensive Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Major features, architectural changes, complex integrations\n\n**Includes everything from MORE plus:**\n\n- Detailed implementation plan with phases\n- Alternative approaches considered\n- Extensive technical specifications\n- Resource requirements and timeline\n- Future considerations and extensibility\n- Risk mitigation strategies\n- Documentation requirements\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n## Overview\n\n[Executive summary]\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n[Detailed problem analysis]\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n[Comprehensive solution design]\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n\n[Detailed technical design]\n\n### Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 1: [Foundation]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n#### Phase 2: [Core Implementation]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n#### Phase 3: [Polish & Optimization]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\n\n[Other solutions evaluated and why rejected]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] Detailed functional criteria\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] Performance targets\n- [ ] Security requirements\n- [ ] Accessibility standards\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n- [ ] Test coverage requirements\n- [ ] Documentation completeness\n- [ ] Code review approval\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n[Detailed KPIs and measurement methods]\n\n## Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n[Detailed dependency analysis]\n\n## Risk Analysis & Mitigation\n\n[Comprehensive risk assessment]\n\n## Resource Requirements\n\n[Team, time, infrastructure needs]\n\n## Future Considerations\n\n[Extensibility and long-term vision]\n\n## Documentation Plan\n\n[What docs need updating]\n\n## References & Research\n\n### Internal References\n\n- Architecture decisions: [file_path:line_number]\n- Similar features: [file_path:line_number]\n- Configuration: [file_path:line_number]\n\n### External References\n\n- Framework documentation: [url]\n- Best practices guide: [url]\n- Industry standards: [url]\n\n### Related Work\n\n- Previous PRs: #[pr_numbers]\n- Related issues: #[issue_numbers]\n- Design documents: [links]\n```\n\n### 5. Issue Creation & Formatting\n\n<thinking>\nApply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand\n</thinking>\n\n**Content Formatting:**\n\n- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)\n- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting\n- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)\n- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off\n- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags\n- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)\n\n**Cross-Referencing:**\n\n- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format\n- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant\n- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)\n- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed\n- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text\n\n**Code & Examples:**\n\n````markdown\n# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references\n\n\n```ruby\n# app/services/user_service.rb:42\ndef process_user(user)\n\n# Implementation here\n\nend\n```\n\n# Collapsible error logs\n\n<details>\n<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>\n\n`Error details here...`\n\n</details>\n````\n\n**AI-Era Considerations:**\n\n- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming\n- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research\n- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)\n- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation\n- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review\n\n### 6. Final Review & Submission\n\n**Pre-submission Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive\n- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue\n- [ ] All template sections are complete\n- [ ] Links and references are working\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable\n- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists\n- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes\n\n## Output Format\n\n**Filename:** Use the date and kebab-case filename from Step 2 Title & Categorization.\n\n```\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<descriptive-name>-plan.md\n```\n\nExamples:\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-user-authentication-flow-plan.md`\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-02-03-fix-checkout-race-condition-plan.md`\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-03-10-refactor-api-client-extraction-plan.md`\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-thing-plan.md` (not descriptive - what \"thing\"?)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-new-feature-plan.md` (too vague - what feature?)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat: user auth-plan.md` (invalid characters - colon and space)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/feat-user-auth-plan.md` (missing date prefix)\n\n## Post-Generation Options\n\nAfter writing the plan file, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to present these options:\n\n**Question:** \"Plan ready at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<name>-plan.md`. What would you like to do next?\"\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Open plan in editor** - Open the plan file for review\n2. **Run `/deepen-plan`** - Enhance each section with parallel research agents (best practices, performance, UI)\n3. **Run `/plan_review`** - Get feedback from reviewers (DHH, Kieran, Simplicity)\n4. **Start `/workflows:work`** - Begin implementing this plan locally\n5. **Start `/workflows:work` on remote** - Begin implementing in Claude Code on the web (use `&` to run in background)\n6. **Create Issue** - Create issue in project tracker (GitHub/Linear)\n7. **Simplify** - Reduce detail level\n\nBased on selection:\n- **Open plan in editor** → Run `open docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md` to open the file in the user's default editor\n- **`/deepen-plan`** → Call the /deepen-plan command with the plan file path to enhance with research\n- **`/plan_review`** → Call the /plan_review command with the plan file path\n- **`/workflows:work`** → Call the /workflows:work command with the plan file path\n- **`/workflows:work` on remote** → Run `/workflows:work docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md &` to start work in background for Claude Code web\n- **Create Issue** → See \"Issue Creation\" section below\n- **Simplify** → Ask \"What should I simplify?\" then regenerate simpler version\n- **Other** (automatically provided) → Accept free text for rework or specific changes\n\n**Note:** If running `/workflows:plan` with ultrathink enabled, automatically run `/deepen-plan` after plan creation for maximum depth and grounding.\n\nLoop back to options after Simplify or Other changes until user selects `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`.\n\n## Issue Creation\n\nWhen user selects \"Create Issue\", detect their project tracker from CLAUDE.md:\n\n1. **Check for tracker preference** in user's CLAUDE.md (global or project):\n   - Look for `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`\n   - Or look for mentions of \"GitHub Issues\" or \"Linear\" in their workflow section\n\n2. **If GitHub:**\n\n   Use the title and type from Step 2 (already in context - no need to re-read the file):\n\n   ```bash\n   gh issue create --title \"<type>: <title>\" --body-file <plan_path>\n   ```\n\n3. **If Linear:**\n\n   ```bash\n   linear issue create --title \"<title>\" --description \"$(cat <plan_path>)\"\n   ```\n\n4. **If no tracker configured:**\n   Ask user: \"Which project tracker do you use? (GitHub/Linear/Other)\"\n   - Suggest adding `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear` to their CLAUDE.md\n\n5. **After creation:**\n   - Display the issue URL\n   - Ask if they want to proceed to `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`\n\nNEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"97308240-9d3f-4479-9806-ecc23d991f64","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:18:02.610Z"}

This can be overridden per-target in the `entitlements` field of `expo-target.config.js`.\n   328→\n   329→Source: [expo-apple-targets README](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets/blob/main/packages/apple-targets/README.md)\n   330→\n   331→---\n   332→\n   333→## 4. WhisperKit SPM Integration (Shared Dependency)\n   334→\n   335→### Current Setup\n   336→\n   337→The project uses `cocoapods-spm` to integrate WhisperKit as an SPM dependency in the CocoaPods-managed project.\n   338→\n   339→**Existing plugin:** `/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/plugins/withWhisperKit.js`\n   340→\n   341→```ruby\n   342→# Generated in Podfile by withWhisperKit.js:\n   343→plugin \"cocoapods-spm\"\n   344→\n   345→spm_pkg \"WhisperKit\",\n   346→  :url => \"https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git\",\n   347→  :version => \"0.9.4\",\n   348→  :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n   349→```\n   350→\n   351→### Challenge: Sharing WhisperKit Between Main App and Extension\n   352→\n   353→The `spm_pkg` declaration in the existing plugin is placed **before** the target blocks, making it available at the global scope. However, for the keyboard extension to also use WhisperKit, the dependency must be linked to both targets.\n   354→\n   355→### Option A: Global spm_pkg (Current Approach)\n   356→\n   357→If the `spm_pkg` is declared at the global (file) scope of the Podfile (outside any `target` block), cocoapods-spm should make it available to all targets. This is the current approach in `withWhisperKit.js`, where the `spm_pkg` is inserted before the first `target` line.\n   358→\n   359→**However, this may not automatically link WhisperKit to the extension target.** The extension target created by `@bacons/apple-targets` uses its own `pods.rb` file evaluated inside a separate `target` block.\n   360→\n   361→### Option B: Declare spm_pkg in Extension's pods.rb\n   362→\n   363→Create `targets/keyboard/pods.rb`:\n   364→\n   365→```ruby\n   366→# targets/keyboard/pods.rb\n   367→spm_pkg \"WhisperKit\",\n   368→  :url => \"https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git\",\n   369→  :version => \"0.9.4\",\n   370→  :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n   371→```\n   372→\n   373→**Risk:** This may cause duplicate SPM package declarations, which cocoapods-spm may or may not handle gracefully. The SPM resolution should deduplicate at the Xcode level, but it needs testing.\n   374→\n   375→### Option C: Shared Embedded Framework (Recommended for Production)\n   376→\n   377→Instead of linking WhisperKit directly to both targets, create an embedded framework that wraps the WhisperKit dependency:\n   378→\n   379→1. Create a new framework target (e.g., `OpenWhisprCore`)\n   380→2. Link WhisperKit only to this framework\n   381→3. Embed the framework in both the main app and keyboard extension\n   382→4. Put shared transcription logic in the framework\n   383→\n   384→This avoids duplicate linking and provides a clean shared code boundary. However, it adds significant complexity to the config plugin setup.\n   385→\n   386→### Option D: Do NOT Use WhisperKit in the Extension\n   387→\n   388→Given the keyboard extension's ~30-48 MB memory limit and the fact that even WhisperKit's tiny model requires ~75 MB on disk (with much more in-memory during inference), **running WhisperKit inside the keyboard extension is not feasible**.\n   389→\n   390→The recommended approach is:\n   391→1. The keyboard extension triggers recording via the main app (background audio session or deep link)\n   392→2. The main app runs WhisperKit transcription\n   393→3. Results are passed back via App Groups shared container\n   394→4. The keyboard extension reads the result and inserts text\n   395→\n   396→**This is the approach used by Willow Voice and is the only viable architecture for voice dictation in a keyboard extension.**\n   397→\n   398→### Memory Constraint Analysis\n   399→\n   400→| Component | Approximate Memory |\n   401→|-----------|-------------------|\n   402→| Keyboard extension baseline (React Native) | ~20-30 MB |\n   403→| WhisperKit runtime | ~10-15 MB |\n   404→| Tiny model loaded | ~75+ MB |\n   405→| **Total** | **~105+ MB** |\n   406→| **Extension memory limit** | **~30-48 MB** |\n   407→\n   408→**Conclusion:** WhisperKit cannot run inside the keyboard extension.

Microphone Access Workarounds\n   705→\n   706→### The Core Problem\n   707→\n   708→iOS keyboard extensions **cannot access the microphone**. This is an Apple security restriction that has been in place since iOS 8 and remains unchanged. No amount of entitlements or permissions can grant microphone access to a keyboard extension.\n   709→\n   710→Source: [Apple Developer Documentation: Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html)\n   711→\n   712→### Workaround A: Background Audio Session (Willow Approach)\n   713→\n   714→This is the approach used by [Willow Voice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/willow-dictation-ai-keyboard/id6753057525), a Y Combinator-backed voice dictation keyboard:\n   715→\n   716→1. User taps the dictation button in the keyboard extension\n   717→2. The keyboard extension opens the main app via URL scheme / deep link\n   718→3. The main app activates a background audio session (`AVAudioSession` with `.playAndRecord` category)\n   719→4. The main app returns the user to the previous app (the audio session remains active in the background)\n   720→5. Audio recording happens in the main app's background process\n   721→6. When the user taps \"stop\" in the keyboard extension, a signal is sent via App Groups\n   722→7. The main app transcribes the audio using WhisperKit\n   723→8. The result is written to the App Groups shared container\n   724→9. The keyboard extension reads the result and inserts it via `textDocumentProxy.insertText()`\n   725→\n   726→**Advantages:**\n   727→- Seamless UX after initial activation\n   728→- Full access to WhisperKit and all app resources\n   729→- No memory constraints from the main app\n   730→\n   731→**Disadvantages:**\n   732→- Requires initial redirect to main app to activate background audio\n   733→- Background audio session may be terminated by iOS after inactivity\n   734→- Shows yellow microphone indicator in Dynamic Island / status bar\n   735→- May cause battery drain if session remains active\n   736→\n   737→Source: [Willow Help: Why am I taken back to the Willow iOS app before I can dictate?](https://help.willowvoice.com/en/articles/12855752-why-am-i-taken-back-to-the-willow-ios-app-before-i-can-dictate)\n   738→\n   739→### Workaround B: Deep Link Per Dictation\n   740→\n   741→1.

User speaks, main app transcribes with WhisperKit\n   745→5. Result is written to App Groups shared UserDefaults\n   746→6. Main app returns user to previous app via `openURL` with the source app's URL scheme (limited) or user manually switches back\n   747→7. Keyboard extension reads and inserts the text\n   748→\n   749→**Advantages:**\n   750→- Simpler implementation\n   751→- No persistent background audio session\n   752→- Less battery impact\n   753→\n   754→**Disadvantages:**\n   755→- Requires app switch for every dictation\n   756→- Disruptive UX\n   757→- Cannot automatically return to the source app reliably\n   758→\n   759→### Workaround C: Cloud-Only Transcription from Extension\n   760→\n   761→Since the keyboard extension has network access (with `RequestsOpenAccess = YES`):\n   762→\n   763→1. Record audio from main app (background session, similar to Workaround A)\n   764→2. Stream audio data to a cloud transcription API directly from the keyboard extension\n   765→3. No local WhisperKit needed in the extension\n   766→\n   767→**Advantages:**\n   768→- Can stream in real-time\n   769→- No WhisperKit memory concerns in extension\n   770→\n   771→**Disadvantages:**\n   772→- Requires network connection\n   773→- Privacy implications (audio leaves device)\n   774→- Still requires background audio session activation from main app\n   775→\n   776→### Recommended Approach: Hybrid (A + B)\n   777→\n   778→Combine the Willow-style background audio session with deep link fallback:\n   779→\n   780→1. First use: Deep link to main app to activate background audio session\n   781→2. Subsequent uses: Background session persists, allowing seamless dictation\n   782→3.

The keyboard extension would allow voice dictation directly within any text field in any iOS app -- the closest analog to the desktop app's auto-paste feature.\n\n**Critical finding:** iOS keyboard extensions **cannot access the microphone**. This is a permanent Apple restriction that applies regardless of `RequestsOpenAccess` settings. The architectural approach must work around this limitation using a background audio session technique (as demonstrated by Willow Voice) or a deep-link-to-main-app pattern.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1.

Apple Keyboard Extension Architecture\n\n### Overview\n\nA Custom Keyboard Extension is an iOS app extension with the extension point identifier `com.apple.keyboard-service`. It replaces the system keyboard with a custom UI built on `UIInputViewController`.\n\nSource: [App Extension Programming Guide: Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html)\n\n### Required Info.plist Keys\n\n```xml\n<key>NSExtension</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSExtensionAttributes</key>\n    <dict>\n        <key>IsASCIICapable</key>\n        <true/>\n        <key>PrefersRightToLeft</key>\n        <false/>\n        <key>PrimaryLanguage</key>\n        <string>en-US</string>\n        <key>RequestsOpenAccess</key>\n        <true/>\n    </dict>\n    <key>NSExtensionPointIdentifier</key>\n    <string>com.apple.keyboard-service</string>\n    <key>NSExtensionPrincipalClass</key>\n    <string>KeyboardViewController</string>\n</dict>\n```\n\n### RequestsOpenAccess Capabilities\n\nWhen `RequestsOpenAccess = YES`, the keyboard gains:\n\n| Capability | Available |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Network access | YES |\n| Shared container with containing app (App Groups) | YES |\n| Location Services (with permission) | YES |\n| Address Book (with permission) | YES |\n| Camera Roll (with permission) | YES |\n| UIPasteboard access | YES |\n| iCloud | YES |\n| Audio playback (keyboard clicks) | YES |\n| **Microphone access** | **NO** |\n| **Camera access** | **NO** |\n\nSource: [Configuring open access for a custom keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/configuring-open-access-for-a-custom-keyboard)\n\n### Hard Limitations\n\n1. **No microphone access** -- \"Custom keyboards, like all app extensions in iOS 8.0, have no access to the device microphone, so dictation input is not possible.\" This has not changed through iOS 18.\n2. **No secure text fields** -- System keyboard takes over for password fields.\n3. **Memory constraints** -- Keyboard extensions have tight memory limits (~30-48 MB based on reports). Exceeding this triggers Jetsam termination.\n4. **No text selection** -- Controlled by the host app.\n5. **No window access** -- Cannot create overlays or windows.\n\nSource: [React Native iOS Custom Keyboard Crashes When Memory limit of 48MB exceeds](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)\n\n### Required Features\n\nEvery custom keyboard must provide:\n- A \"Next Keyboard\" button (call `advanceToNextInputMode()`)\n- Respond to keyboard type traits (`UIKeyboardType`)\n- Basic text insertion/deletion via `textDocumentProxy`\n\n---\n\n## 2. Expo Config Plugin Patterns for Extension Targets\n\n### Available Mod Plugins\n\nExpo provides these mod plugins for iOS modifications during prebuild:\n\n| Mod Plugin | Target File | Access |\n|-----------|-------------|--------|\n| `withInfoPlist` | `ios/<name>/Info.plist` | JSON object |\n| `withEntitlementsPlist` | `ios/<name>/<product>.entitlements` | JSON object |\n| `withXcodeProject` | `ios/<name>.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` | XcodeProject object (via `xcode` npm package) |\n| `withPodfile` | `ios/Podfile` | String |\n| `withDangerousMod` | Any file in `ios/` | Raw filesystem access |\n\nSource: [Expo Config Plugins: Mods](https://docs.expo.dev/config-plugins/mods/)\n\n### Pattern: Adding a New Xcode Target via withXcodeProject\n\nThe `withXcodeProject` mod provides access to the parsed `.pbxproj` file through `config.modResults`. To add a new target, you need to:\n\n1. Create a `PBXNativeTarget` entry\n2. Create an `XCConfigurationList` for the target's build settings\n3. Add build phases (Sources, Resources, Frameworks, Embed)\n4. Register the target in `PBXProject` section\n5. Add target dependency from main app to extension\n6. Create a `PBXGroup` for the extension's source files\n\n```javascript\nconst { withXcodeProject } = require(\"@expo/config-plugins\");\n\nfunction withKeyboardExtension(config) {\n  return withXcodeProject(config, async (config) => {\n    const xcodeProject = config.modResults;\n\n    // Find existing file references\n    const fileReferences = xcodeProject.hash.project.objects[\"PBXFileReference\"];\n\n    // Generate UUIDs for new entries\n    const targetUuid = xcodeProject.generateUuid();\n\n    // Add to PBXBuildFile section\n    xcodeProject.addToPbxBuildFileSection({\n      uuid: fileUuid,\n      isa: \"PBXBuildFile\",\n      fileRef: fileRefUUID,\n      basename: \"KeyboardViewController.swift\",\n      group: \"Sources\",\n    });\n\n    // Add to Sources build phase\n    xcodeProject.addToPbxSourcesBuildPhase({\n      uuid: fileUuid,\n      basename: \"KeyboardViewController.swift\",\n      group: \"Sources\",\n      target: targetUuid,\n    });\n\n    return config;\n  });\n}\n```\n\nSource: [How to add a new target to your file with Expo config plugin](https://www.reactnativecrossroads.com/posts/config-plugin-expo-add-target/)\n\n### Pattern: Adding Entitlements via withEntitlementsPlist\n\n```javascript\nconst { withEntitlementsPlist } = require(\"@expo/config-plugins\");\n\nfunction withAppGroups(config, { groupIdentifier }) {\n  return withEntitlementsPlist(config, (config) => {\n    config.modResults[\"com.apple.security.application-groups\"] = [groupIdentifier];\n    return config;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Pattern: Modifying Podfile via withDangerousMod\n\nThis is what the project's existing `withWhisperKit.js` plugin uses:\n\n```javascript\n// File: /Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/plugins/withWhisperKit.js\nconst { withDangerousMod } = require(\"@expo/config-plugins\");\n// ... reads Podfile, inserts cocoapods-spm plugin and spm_pkg declaration\n```\n\n### Existing expo-keyboard-extension Plugin Architecture\n\nThe `expo-keyboard-extension` package (by cmaycumber) provides a reference implementation with these modules:\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `withKeyboardExtensionTarget.ts` | Creates PBXNativeTarget, build phases, build settings |\n| `withAppEntitlements.ts` | Adds App Groups to main app entitlements |\n| `withKeyboardExtensionEntitlements.ts` | Writes extension .entitlements file with App Groups |\n| `withKeyboardExtensionInfoPlist.ts` | Writes extension Info.plist with NSExtension keys |\n| `withPodfile.ts` | Adds extension target to Podfile for CocoaPods |\n| `withExpoConfig.ts` | Modifies Expo configuration |\n\nSource: [expo-keyboard-extension on GitHub](https://github.com/cmaycumber/expo-keyboard-extension)\n\n---\n\n## 3. @bacons/apple-targets Package\n\n### Overview\n\n`@bacons/apple-targets` is an experimental Expo Config Plugin by Evan Bacon that generates native Apple targets (widgets, App Clips, keyboard extensions, etc.) and manages them outside the `/ios` directory, compatible with Continuous Native Generation.\n\n**Latest version:** 4.0.2 (as of February 2026)\n\nSource: [@bacons/apple-targets on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bacons/apple-targets)\n\n### Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Minimum Version |\n|------------|----------------|\n| CocoaPods | 1.16.2 |\n| Ruby | 3.2.0 |\n| Xcode | 16 |\n| macOS | 15 Sequoia |\n| **Expo SDK** | **53+** |\n\n**Compatibility note:** The current project uses Expo SDK 54 (`\"expo\": \"~54.0.33\"` in `package.json`), which meets the SDK 53+ requirement.\n\n### Keyboard Extension Support\n\nThe `keyboard` target type is explicitly supported in the `TARGET_REGISTRY` (from `src/target.ts`):\n\n```typescript\nkeyboard: {\n  extensionPointIdentifier: \"com.apple.keyboard-service\",\n  needsEmbeddedSwift: true,\n  appGroupsByDefault: true,\n  displayName: \"Keyboard Extension\",\n  description: \"Custom system keyboard\",\n}\n```\n\nKey properties:\n- `needsEmbeddedSwift: true` -- The plugin embeds Swift runtime in the extension\n- `appGroupsByDefault: true` -- App Groups entitlements are automatically configured\n\n### Directory Structure\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── targets/\n│   ├── keyboard/                          # Keyboard extension target\n│   │   ├── expo-target.config.js          # Target configuration\n│   │   ├── KeyboardViewController.swift   # Main keyboard controller\n│   │   ├── Info.plist                     #

Files linked to ALL targets\n│       └── SharedTranscriptionEngine.swift\n├── app.json\n└── ...\n```\n\n### Configuration File\n\n`targets/keyboard/expo-target.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('@bacons/apple-targets').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  type: \"keyboard\",\n  name: \"OpenWhisprKeyboard\",\n  displayName: \"OpenWhispr Voice\",\n  // Dot-prefix appends to main app bundle ID\n  bundleIdentifier: \".keyboard\",\n  // Results in: com.openwhispr.mobile.keyboard\n  deploymentTarget: \"17.0\",\n  frameworks: [\"UIKit\"],\n  entitlements: {\n    \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n      \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\",\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Setup Workflow\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install the package\nnpm install @bacons/apple-targets\n\n# 2. Generate keyboard target scaffold\nnpx create-target keyboard\n\n# 3. Add to app.json plugins\n# (auto-added by create-target)\n\n# 4. Set Apple Team ID in app.json\n# ios.appleTeamId: \"YOUR_TEAM_ID\"\n\n# 5. Prebuild\nnpx expo prebuild -p ios --clean\n\n# 6. Open in Xcode\nxed ios\n```\n\n### CocoaPods Integration for Extension Targets\n\n`@bacons/apple-targets` modifies the Podfile to dynamically load `pods.rb` files from each target directory:\n\n```ruby\n# Auto-appended to Podfile by the plugin:\nDir.glob(File.join(__dir__, '..', 'targets', '**', 'pods.rb')).each do |target_file|\n  target_name = File.basename(File.dirname(target_file))\n  target target_name do\n    target_binding = binding\n    target_binding.local_variable_set(:podfile_properties, podfile_properties)\n    eval(File.read(target_file), target_binding, target_file)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis means you can add a `targets/keyboard/pods.rb` file to declare CocoaPods dependencies for the keyboard extension target.\n\n### App Groups Entitlements\n\nTargets with `appGroupsByDefault: true` automatically inherit app groups from the main app's `ios.entitlements` in `app.json`. This can be overridden per-target in the `entitlements` field of `expo-target.config.js`.\n\nSource: [expo-apple-targets README](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets/blob/main/packages/apple-targets/README.md)\n\n---\n\n## 4. WhisperKit SPM Integration (Shared Dependency)\n\n### Current Setup\n\nThe project uses `cocoapods-spm` to integrate WhisperKit as an SPM dependency in the CocoaPods-managed project.\n\n**Existing plugin:** `/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/plugins/withWhisperKit.js`\n\n```ruby\n# Generated in Podfile by withWhisperKit.js:\nplugin \"cocoapods-spm\"\n\nspm_pkg \"WhisperKit\",\n  :url => \"https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git\",\n  :version => \"0.9.4\",\n  :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n```\n\n### Challenge: Sharing WhisperKit Between Main App and Extension\n\nThe `spm_pkg` declaration in the existing plugin is placed **before** the target blocks, making it available at the global scope. However, for the keyboard extension to also use WhisperKit, the dependency must be linked to both targets.\n\n### Option A: Global spm_pkg (Current Approach)\n\nIf the `spm_pkg` is declared at the global (file) scope of the Podfile (outside any `target` block), cocoapods-spm should make it available to all targets. This is the current approach in `withWhisperKit.js`, where the `spm_pkg` is inserted before the first `target` line.\n\n**However, this may not automatically link WhisperKit to the extension target.** The extension target created by `@bacons/apple-targets` uses its own `pods.rb` file evaluated inside a separate `target` block.\n\n### Option B: Declare spm_pkg in Extension's pods.rb\n\nCreate `targets/keyboard/pods.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n# targets/keyboard/pods.rb\nspm_pkg \"WhisperKit\",\n  :url => \"https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git\",\n  :version => \"0.9.4\",\n  :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n```\n\n**Risk:** This may cause duplicate SPM package declarations, which cocoapods-spm may or may not handle gracefully. The SPM resolution should deduplicate at the Xcode level, but it needs testing.\n\n### Option C: Shared Embedded Framework (Recommended for Production)\n\nInstead of linking WhisperKit directly to both targets, create an embedded framework that wraps the WhisperKit dependency:\n\n1. Create a new framework target (e.g., `OpenWhisprCore`)\n2. Link WhisperKit only to this framework\n3. Embed the framework in both the main app and keyboard extension\n4. Put shared transcription logic in the framework\n\nThis avoids duplicate linking and provides a clean shared code boundary. However, it adds significant complexity to the config plugin setup.\n\n### Option D: Do NOT Use WhisperKit in the Extension\n\nGiven the keyboard extension's ~30-48 MB memory limit and the fact that even WhisperKit's tiny model requires ~75 MB on disk (with much more in-memory during inference), **running WhisperKit inside the keyboard extension is not feasible**.\n\nThe recommended approach is:\n1. The keyboard extension triggers recording via the main app (background audio session or deep link)\n2. The main app runs WhisperKit transcription\n3. Results are passed back via App Groups shared container\n4. The keyboard extension reads the result and inserts text\n\n**This is the approach used by Willow Voice and is the only viable architecture for voice dictation in a keyboard extension.**\n\n### Memory Constraint Analysis\n\n| Component | Approximate Memory |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| Keyboard extension baseline (React Native) | ~20-30 MB |\n| WhisperKit runtime | ~10-15 MB |\n| Tiny model loaded | ~75+ MB |\n| **Total** | **~105+ MB** |\n| **Extension memory limit** | **~30-48 MB** |\n\n**Conclusion:** WhisperKit cannot run inside the keyboard extension. The transcription must happen in the main app process.\n\n---\n\n## 5. App Groups Entitlement via Config Plugin\n\n### What App Groups Enable\n\nApp Groups allow the main app and keyboard extension to share:\n\n- `UserDefaults(suiteName: \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\")` -- Key-value storage\n- Shared container directory (files, SQLite databases)\n- Core Data persistent stores\n- MMKV storage (if configured with the group container path)\n\n### Configuration in app.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"ios\": {\n      \"entitlements\": {\n        \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n          \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSource: [iOS capabilities - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/ios-capabilities/)\n\n### Config Plugin for Main App Entitlements\n\nUsing `withEntitlementsPlist`:\n\n```javascript\nconst { withEntitlementsPlist } = require(\"@expo/config-plugins\");\n\nconst APP_GROUP = \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\";\n\nfunction withAppGroups(config) {\n  return withEntitlementsPlist(config, (config) => {\n    const existing = config.modResults[\"com.apple.security.application-groups\"] || [];\n    if (!existing.includes(APP_GROUP)) {\n      config.modResults[\"com.apple.security.application-groups\"] = [...existing, APP_GROUP];\n    }\n    return config;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Config Plugin for Extension Entitlements\n\nWhen using `@bacons/apple-targets`, the extension entitlements are configured in `expo-target.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  type: \"keyboard\",\n  entitlements: {\n    \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n      \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\",\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nWhen writing a custom plugin, you must write the extension's `.entitlements` file directly:\n\n```javascript\nconst { withDangerousMod } = require(\"@expo/config-plugins\");\nconst plist = require(\"@expo/plist\");\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nfunction withKeyboardEntitlements(config) {\n  return withDangerousMod(config, [\"ios\", (config) => {\n    const targetDir = path.join(\n      config.modRequest.platformProjectRoot,\n      \"OpenWhisprKeyboard\"\n    );\n    fs.mkdirSync(targetDir, { recursive: true });\n\n    const entitlements = {\n      \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n        \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\",\n      ],\n    };\n\n    fs.writeFileSync(\n      path.join(targetDir, \"OpenWhisprKeyboard.entitlements\"),\n      plist.build(entitlements)\n    );\n\n    return config;\n  }]);\n}\n```\n\n### Sharing Data via App Groups\n\n**Swift (in keyboard extension or main app):**\n\n```swift\n// Write from main app\nlet sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\")\nsharedDefaults?.set(\"transcribed text here\", forKey: \"lastTranscription\")\nsharedDefaults?.synchronize() // Force immediate write\n\n// Read from keyboard extension\nlet sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\")\nlet text = sharedDefaults?.string(forKey: \"lastTranscription\")\n```\n\n**For larger data (audio files, models), use the shared container:**\n\n```swift\nlet containerURL = FileManager.default.containerURL(\n  forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n)\nlet audioFile = containerURL?.appendingPathComponent(\"recording.wav\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Shared Frameworks Between App and Extension\n\n### Approach A: Embedded Framework (Recommended for Complex Sharing)\n\nCreate a dynamic framework that contains shared code:\n\n```\nproject-root/\n├── targets/\n│   ├── keyboard/\n│   │   └── ...\n│   └── _shared/                           # @bacons/apple-targets shared directory\n│       ├── TranscriptionCoordinator.swift  # Shared protocol/interface\n│       └── AppGroupStorage.swift           # Shared UserDefaults/file access\n```\n\nWith `@bacons/apple-targets`, files in `targets/_shared/` are automatically linked to all targets.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Single copy of shared code\n- Clean dependency boundary\n- Smaller total binary size\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- More complex build setup\n- Framework must use only extension-safe APIs (`APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY = YES`)\n\n### Approach B: Shared Source Files via @bacons/apple-targets\n\nUsing the `_shared` directory convention in `@bacons/apple-targets`:\n\n```\ntargets/\n├── keyboard/\n│   ├── expo-target.config.js\n│   └── KeyboardViewController.swift\n└── _shared/\n    ├── AppGroupStorage.swift       # Shared data access\n    └── TranscriptionProtocol.swift # Shared interfaces\n```\n\nFiles in `targets/_shared/` are automatically added to all target build phases by the plugin.\n\n**This is the simplest approach** for sharing code between the main app and extension when using `@bacons/apple-targets`.\n\n### Approach C: Duplicate Source Files (Simplest but Not Recommended)\n\nAdd the same Swift files to both target memberships. Simple but leads to maintenance issues and increased binary size.\n\n### Extension-Safe API Requirement\n\nWhen sharing code with an extension, the build setting `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY` must be `YES` on the framework. This prevents use of APIs unavailable in extensions (e.g., `UIApplication.shared`, background tasks).\n\nSource: [Preparing Your iOS App for Extensions](https://www.rightpoint.com/rplabs/preparing-app-extensions-ios)\n\n---\n\n## 7. EAS Build Considerations\n\n### Declaring Extension Targets for EAS\n\nEAS Build needs to know about extension targets before the build starts for proper credential management. Declare them in `app.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"extra\": {\n      \"eas\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"experimental\": {\n            \"ios\": {\n              \"appExtensions\": [\n                {\n                  \"targetName\": \"OpenWhisprKeyboard\",\n                  \"bundleIdentifier\": \"com.openwhispr.mobile.keyboard\",\n                  \"entitlements\": {\n                    \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n                      \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n                    ]\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSource: [iOS App Extensions - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/app-extensions/)\n\n### Automatic vs. Manual Credential Management\n\n**Automatic (EAS Managed):**\n- EAS Build automatically synchronizes capabilities with Apple Developer Console\n- For the main app target, provisioning profiles are auto-generated\n- For extension targets declared in `appExtensions`, EAS should generate separate provisioning profiles\n\n**Known Issues:**\n- EAS has had bugs where it fails to generate provisioning profiles for extension targets automatically\n- The `@bacons/apple-targets` plugin includes `with-eas-credentials.ts` that automatically populates the `appExtensions` array from the Xcode project, reducing manual configuration\n\n**Workaround if automatic fails:**\n1. Use `eas credentials` to manually create provisioning profiles for the extension\n2. Provide credentials via `credentials.json`\n3. Select a team within Xcode for both app and extension targets before building\n\nSource: [EAS Build Fails to generate provisioning profile for extension](https://github.com/achorein/expo-share-intent/issues/154)\n\n### Capability Synchronization\n\nEAS Build automatically syncs capabilities (including App Groups) with Apple Developer Console:\n\n```bash\n# Normal sync\neas build -p ios\n\n# Disable auto-sync if needed\nEXPO_NO_CAPABILITY_SYNC=1 eas build -p ios\n\n# Debug logging\nEXPO_DEBUG=1 eas build -p ios\n```\n\nSource: [iOS capabilities - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/ios-capabilities/)\n\n### eas.json Configuration\n\nNo special `eas.json` changes are typically needed for extension targets. The standard iOS build profile works:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"build\": {\n    \"development\": {\n      \"developmentClient\": true,\n      \"distribution\": \"internal\",\n      \"ios\": {\n        \"simulator\": false\n      }\n    },\n    \"production\": {\n      \"ios\": {\n        \"buildConfiguration\": \"Release\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### CocoaPods Version Requirement\n\n`@bacons/apple-targets` requires CocoaPods 1.16.2+. EAS Build images should have a recent enough version, but verify with:\n\n```bash\n# In eas.json, specify image if needed:\n{\n  \"build\": {\n    \"production\": {\n      \"ios\": {\n        \"image\": \"macos-sequoia-xcode-16\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 8. Microphone Access Workarounds\n\n### The Core Problem\n\niOS keyboard extensions **cannot access the microphone**. This is an Apple security restriction that has been in place since iOS 8 and remains unchanged. No amount of entitlements or permissions can grant microphone access to a keyboard extension.\n\nSource: [Apple Developer Documentation: Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html)\n\n### Workaround A: Background Audio Session (Willow Approach)\n\nThis is the approach used by [Willow Voice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/willow-dictation-ai-keyboard/id6753057525), a Y Combinator-backed voice dictation keyboard:\n\n1. User taps the dictation button in the keyboard extension\n2. The keyboard extension opens the main app via URL scheme / deep link\n3. The main app activates a background audio session (`AVAudioSession` with `.playAndRecord` category)\n4. The main app returns the user to the previous app (the audio session remains active in the background)\n5. Audio recording happens in the main app's background process\n6. When the user taps \"stop\" in the keyboard extension, a signal is sent via App Groups\n7. The main app transcribes the audio using WhisperKit\n8. The result is written to the App Groups shared container\n9. The keyboard extension reads the result and inserts it via `textDocumentProxy.insertText()`\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Seamless UX after initial activation\n- Full access to WhisperKit and all app resources\n- No memory constraints from the main app\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Requires initial redirect to main app to activate background audio\n- Background audio session may be terminated by iOS after inactivity\n- Shows yellow microphone indicator in Dynamic Island / status bar\n- May cause battery drain if session remains active\n\nSource: [Willow Help: Why am I taken back to the Willow iOS app before I can dictate?](https://help.willowvoice.com/en/articles/12855752-why-am-i-taken-back-to-the-willow-ios-app-before-i-can-dictate)\n\n### Workaround B: Deep Link Per Dictation\n\n1. User taps dictation button in keyboard extension\n2. Keyboard extension opens main app via URL scheme: `openwhispr://dictate`\n3. Main app presents a recording UI overlay\n4. User speaks, main app transcribes with WhisperKit\n5. Result is written to App Groups shared UserDefaults\n6. Main app returns user to previous app via `openURL` with the source app's URL scheme (limited) or user manually switches back\n7. Keyboard extension reads and inserts the text\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Simpler implementation\n- No persistent background audio session\n- Less battery impact\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Requires app switch for every dictation\n- Disruptive UX\n- Cannot automatically return to the source app reliably\n\n### Workaround C: Cloud-Only Transcription from Extension\n\nSince the keyboard extension has network access (with `RequestsOpenAccess = YES`):\n\n1. Record audio from main app (background session, similar to Workaround A)\n2. Stream audio data to a cloud transcription API directly from the keyboard extension\n3. No local WhisperKit needed in the extension\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Can stream in real-time\n- No WhisperKit memory concerns in extension\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Requires network connection\n- Privacy implications (audio leaves device)\n- Still requires background audio session activation from main app\n\n### Recommended Approach: Hybrid (A + B)\n\nCombine the Willow-style background audio session with deep link fallback:\n\n1. First use: Deep link to main app to activate background audio session\n2. Subsequent uses: Background session persists, allowing seamless dictation\n3. If background session expires: Deep link again to reactivate\n4. Always transcribe in main app process (WhisperKit), share results via App Groups\n\n---\n\n## 9. Recommended Implementation Approach\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\n```\n+---------------------------+     App Groups     +---------------------------+\n|     Main App (Expo)       | <================> |   Keyboard Extension      |\n|                           |   (UserDefaults    |   (Native Swift)          |\n|  - WhisperKit Module      |    + shared files) |                           |\n|  - Audio Recording        |                    |  - KeyboardViewController |\n|  - Background Audio Svc   |                    |  - Dictation Button       |\n|  - Transcription Engine   |                    |  - Text Insertion         |\n|  - Model Management       |                    |  - App Group Reader       |\n+---------------------------+                    +---------------------------+\n```\n\n### Step 1: Use @bacons/apple-targets\n\nSince the project runs Expo SDK 54 and `@bacons/apple-targets` supports SDK 53+, use this package to manage the keyboard extension target.\n\n```bash\nnpm install @bacons/apple-targets\nnpx create-target keyboard\n```\n\n### Step 2: Configure the Keyboard Target\n\n`targets/keyboard/expo-target.config.js`:\n\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('@bacons/apple-targets').Config} */\nmodule.exports = (config) => ({\n  type: \"keyboard\",\n  name: \"OpenWhisprKeyboard\",\n  displayName: \"OpenWhispr Voice\",\n  bundleIdentifier: \".keyboard\",\n  deploymentTarget: \"17.0\",\n  frameworks: [\"UIKit\"],\n  entitlements: {\n    \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n      `group.${config.ios.bundleIdentifier}`,\n    ],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add App Groups to Main App\n\nIn `app.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"expo\": {\n    \"ios\": {\n      \"entitlements\": {\n        \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n          \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"extra\": {\n      \"eas\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"experimental\": {\n            \"ios\": {\n              \"appExtensions\": [\n                {\n                  \"targetName\": \"OpenWhisprKeyboard\",\n                  \"bundleIdentifier\": \"com.openwhispr.mobile.keyboard\",\n                  \"entitlements\": {\n                    \"com.apple.security.application-groups\": [\n                      \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n                    ]\n                  }\n                }\n              ]\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement Native Keyboard Extension (Swift)\n\n`targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift`:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\n\nclass KeyboardViewController: UIInputViewController {\n    private let appGroupID = \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n    private var dictateButton: UIButton!\n    private var nextKeyboardButton: UIButton!\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        setupUI()\n        observeTranscriptionResults()\n    }\n\n    private func setupUI() {\n        // Next Keyboard button (required by Apple)\n        nextKeyboardButton = UIButton(type: .system)\n        nextKeyboardButton.setTitle(\"Next\", for: .normal)\n        nextKeyboardButton.addTarget(\n            self, action: #selector(handleInputModeList(from:with:)),\n            for: .allTouchEvents\n        )\n\n        // Dictate button\n        dictateButton = UIButton(type: .system)\n        dictateButton.setTitle(\"Dictate\", for: .normal)\n        dictateButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(startDictation), for: .touchUpInside)\n\n        // Layout\n        let stack = UIStackView(arrangedSubviews: [nextKeyboardButton, dictateButton])\n        stack.axis = .horizontal\n        stack.distribution = .fillEqually\n        stack.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false\n        view.addSubview(stack)\n\n        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([\n            stack.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),\n            stack.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),\n            stack.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor),\n            stack.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor),\n        ])\n    }\n\n    @objc private func startDictation() {\n        // Signal main app to start recording\n        let sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: appGroupID)\n        sharedDefaults?.set(\"start\", forKey: \"dictationCommand\")\n        sharedDefaults?.synchronize()\n\n        // Open main app to activate background audio session\n        let url = URL(string: \"openwhispr://dictate\")!\n        // Note: openURL is available in keyboard extensions with RequestsOpenAccess\n        let selector = NSSelectorFromString(\"openURL:\")\n        var responder: UIResponder? = self\n        while let r = responder {\n            if r.responds(to: selector) {\n                r.perform(selector, with: url)\n                break\n            }\n            responder = r.next\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func observeTranscriptionResults() {\n        // Poll or use Darwin notifications for real-time updates\n        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.5, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in\n            self?.checkForTranscriptionResult()\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func checkForTranscriptionResult() {\n        let sharedDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: appGroupID)\n        if let text = sharedDefaults?.string(forKey: \"transcriptionResult\"),\n           !text.isEmpty {\n            textDocumentProxy.insertText(text)\n            sharedDefaults?.removeObject(forKey: \"transcriptionResult\")\n            sharedDefaults?.synchronize()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 5: Shared Code via _shared Directory\n\n`targets/_shared/AppGroupStorage.swift`:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\npublic struct AppGroupStorage {\n    public static let groupIdentifier = \"group.com.openwhispr.mobile\"\n\n    public static var sharedDefaults: UserDefaults? {\n        UserDefaults(suiteName: groupIdentifier)\n    }\n\n    public static var sharedContainerURL: URL? {\n        FileManager.default.containerURL(\n            forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: groupIdentifier\n        )\n    }\n\n    // Keys for keyboard <-> app communication\n    public enum Key {\n        public static let dictationCommand = \"dictationCommand\"\n        public static let transcriptionResult = \"transcriptionResult\"\n        public static let isRecording = \"isRecording\"\n        public static let selectedModel = \"selectedModel\"\n        public static let selectedLanguage = \"selectedLanguage\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 6: WhisperKit Stays in Main App Only\n\nWhisperKit is NOT linked to the keyboard extension target. The existing `withWhisperKit.js` config plugin only adds it to the main app's Podfile target. The keyboard extension communicates with the main app via App Groups.\n\nThe existing WhisperKit module at `/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/modules/whisperkit/` remains unchanged. The main app handles all transcription and writes results to the shared container.\n\n### Step 7: Background Audio Session in Main App\n\nAdd a new native module or extend the existing WhisperKit module to support background audio recording triggered by the keyboard extension:\n\n```swift\n// In main app: BackgroundDictationService.swift\nimport AVFoundation\n\nclass BackgroundDictationService {\n    static let shared = BackgroundDictationService()\n\n    private var audioSession: AVAudioSession { .sharedInstance() }\n    private var isSessionActive = false\n\n    func activateBackgroundAudioSession() throws {\n        try audioSession.setCategory(\n            .playAndRecord,\n            mode: .default,\n            options: [.defaultToSpeaker, .allowBluetooth, .mixWithOthers]\n        )\n        try audioSession.setActive(true)\n        isSessionActive = true\n    }\n\n    func observeKeyboardCommands() {\n        // Watch App Group for dictation start/stop commands\n        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.3, repeats: true) { [weak self] _ in\n            let defaults = AppGroupStorage.sharedDefaults\n            if let command = defaults?.string(forKey: AppGroupStorage.Key.dictationCommand) {\n                switch command {\n                case \"start\":\n                    self?.startRecording()\n                case \"stop\":\n                    self?.stopRecordingAndTranscribe()\n                default:\n                    break\n                }\n                defaults?.removeObject(forKey: AppGroupStorage.Key.dictationCommand)\n                defaults?.synchronize()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 10.

Use **WhisperKit** for local transcription (Core ML optimized for Apple Silicon), bridged via a custom **Expo Module** written in Swift. Reuse the model registry JSON and API integration patterns from the desktop app.\n    49→\n    50→### Technology Stack\n    51→\n    52→| Category | Desktop (Current) | iOS (Proposed) |\n    53→|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n    54→| **Framework** | Electron 36 + React 19 | React Native + Expo SDK 52+ |\n    55→| **Local STT** | whisper.cpp binary | WhisperKit (Core ML, Neural Engine) |\n    56→| **Audio Recording** | MediaRecorder API | expo-av (AVAudioRecorder) |\n    57→| **Database** | better-sqlite3 | expo-sqlite + Drizzle ORM |\n    58→| **Settings

Architecture Differences from Desktop\n    69→\n    70→1. **No IPC bridge** -- React Native communicates with native modules directly via JSI\n    71→2. **No CORS** -- All API calls (including Anthropic) can be made directly from JS\n    72→3. **WhisperKit replaces whisper.cpp** -- Core ML optimized, runs on Apple Neural Engine\n    73→4. **No FFmpeg needed** -- expo-av handles audio format natively\n    74→5. **Clipboard is simpler** -- No platform-specific automation, just expo-clipboard\n    75→6. **Single window** -- Tab navigation replaces dual-window architecture\n    76→7. **MMKV replaces localStorage** -- Synchronous, encrypted, faster\n    77→\n    78→## Technical Approach\n    79→\n    80→### Architecture\n    81→\n    82→```\n    83→openwhispr-mobile/\n    84→├── app/

WhisperKit provides significantly better performance on iOS via Core ML and Neural Engine optimization. The user specifically requested WhisperKit.\n   358→\n   359→### 2. whisper-kit-expo (existing npm package) instead of custom Expo Module\n   360→\n   361→**Pros:** Ready-made, less native code to write\n   362→**Cons:** Limited API surface (only `transcribe()` and `loadTranscriber()`), no model management APIs, unclear maintenance status, no streaming support, no progress events for model downloads\n   363→**Decision:** Rejected for primary integration. May reference its cocoapods-spm setup pattern. Building a custom Expo Module gives full control over the WhisperKit API surface.\n   364→\n   365→### 3. Swift + SwiftUI instead of React Native\n   366→\n   367→**Pros:** Best iOS performance, native WhisperKit integration (no bridge), full platform API access\n   368→**Cons:** No code sharing with desktop React codebase, new language for the team, longer development time for full feature set\n   369→**Decision:** Rejected per user preference for React Native.\n   370→\n   371→### 4. Bare React Native (no Expo)\n   372→\n   373→**Pros:** Full native control from day one\n   374→**Cons:** More complex build setup, manual native module linking, no OTA updates, harder upgrades\n   375→**Decision:** Rejected. Expo SDK 52+ with development builds provides full native access while offering better DX (expo-router, config plugins, EAS Build).\n   376→\n   377→## Acceptance Criteria\n   378→\n   379→### Functional Requirements\n   380→\n   381→- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe locally using WhisperKit on-device\n   382→- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe via cloud providers (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral)\n   383→- [ ] User can configure and use AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq)\n   384→- [ ] User can name their agent and trigger AI processing with \"Hey [AgentName]\"\n   385→- [ ] User can view, search, copy, share, and delete transcription history\n   386→- [ ] User can manage custom dictionary words\n   387→- [ ] User can download, select, and delete WhisperKit models\n   388→- [ ] User can securely store and manage API keys for all providers\n   389→- [ ] User can select from 58+ transcription languages\n   390→- [ ] User completes onboarding flow on first launch\n   391→- [ ] App works offline for local transcription (model pre-downloaded)\n   392→\n   393→### Non-Functional Requirements\n   394→\n   395→- [ ] iOS deployment target: 17.0+\n   396→- [ ] WhisperKit transcription completes in <5s for 30s audio on iPhone 14+\n   397→- [ ] App launch to record-ready in <2s (model pre-loaded)\n   398→- [ ] Memory usage stays under 1.5GB during transcription\n   399→- [ ] API keys stored in iOS Keychain (not plain storage)\n   400→- [ ] Audio recording at 16kHz mono WAV for WhisperKit compatibility\n   401→- [ ] Microphone permission handled gracefully (request, denial, revocation)\n   402→- [ ] VoiceOver accessible on all screens\n   403→\n   404→### Quality Gates\n   405→\n   406→- [ ] Tested on physical devices: iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 16 (minimum 3 generations)\n   407→- [ ] All screens pass VoiceOver audit\n   408→- [ ] No memory leaks during extended recording sessions\n   409→- [ ] App Store review requirements met (privacy policy, usage descriptions)\n   410→\n   411→## Dependencies & Prerequisites\n   412→\n   413→1. **Apple Developer Account** -- Required for physical device testing and App Store submission\n   414→2. **WhisperKit v0.9+** -- Swift Package, MIT license\n   415→3. **Expo SDK 52+** -- Framework with development builds\n   416→4. **Physical iOS device** -- WhisperKit requires Neural Engine (Simulator insufficient for testing)\n   417→5. **OpenWhispr cloud backend** -- For auth, cloud transcription, billing (if Phase 6 included)\n   418→\n   419→## Risk Analysis & Mitigation\n   420→\n   421→| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n   422→|------|-----------|--------|------------|\n   423→| WhisperKit Expo Module bridging complexity | Medium | High | Start with proof-of-concept in Phase 2; reference whisper-kit-expo's cocoapods-spm pattern |\n   424→| Large model downloads fail on mobile networks | Medium | Medium | Implement resume/retry, cellular warnings, disk space checks, background URLSession downloads |\n   425→| Memory pressure with large WhisperKit models | Medium | High | Filter models by device capability, implement memory monitoring, fallback to smaller model |\n   426→| iOS background audio restrictions | Low | Medium | Use UIBackgroundModes audio, test extensively, document limitations |\n   427→| App Store rejection (audio recording app) | Low | High | Include comprehensive privacy policy, proper NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, no unnecessary permissions |\n   428→| WhisperKit API breaking changes | Low | Medium | Pin to specific version, test during upgrades |\n   429→\n   430→## Deferred to Future Versions\n   431→\n   432→These features from the desktop app or iOS-specific enhancements are **not included in v1**:\n   433→\n   434→| Feature | Reason for Deferral |\n   435→|---------|-------------------|\n   436→| **Streaming transcription (Deepgram/AssemblyAI)** | Adds significant complexity; batch transcription covers core use case |\n   437→| **Local LLM reasoning (llama.cpp)** | Resource-intensive on mobile; cloud reasoning available |\n   438→| **NVIDIA Parakeet (sherpa-onnx)** | iOS-only app; WhisperKit provides superior iOS transcription |\n   439→| **Keyboard extension** | Separate Xcode target; complex shared storage; v2 feature |\n   440→| **Siri Shortcuts** | Nice-to-have; not core functionality |\n   441→| **Live Activities / Dynamic Island** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n   442→| **iOS Widget** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n   443→| **Cross-platform data sync** | Requires backend changes; desktop and mobile are separate projects |\n   444→| **iPad-optimized layout** | Universal app runs on iPad; dedicated layout is v2 |\n   445→\n   446→## Text Output Strategy (Critical UX Decision)\n   447→\n   448→The desktop app's core value is auto-paste: record speech and it appears in whatever app you were using. **iOS sandboxing prevents this.**\n   449→\n   450→### v1 Approach: Copy + Share\n   451→\n   452→1. After transcription, text is displayed on screen\n   453→2. **Copy button** -- copies text to iOS clipboard (one tap)\n   454→3. **Share button** -- opens iOS Share Sheet (send to any app: Messages, Notes, Mail, etc.)\n   455→4. **Auto-copy setting** -- optionally auto-copy to clipboard after every transcription\n   456→\n   457→### v2 Approach: Custom Keyboard Extension\n   458→\n   459→A keyboard extension would allow voice dictation directly within any text field in any app -- the closest analog to the desktop's auto-paste. This is the most impactful iOS-specific feature but requires a separate Xcode target and shared App Group storage.\n   460→\n   461→---\n   462→\n   463→## v2 Feature Plan: Custom Keyboard Extension\n   464→\n   465→### Overview\n   466→\n   467→Build an iOS Custom Keyboard Extension that enables voice-to-text dictation directly within any text field in any app. The user switches to the OpenWhispr keyboard, taps a microphone button, speaks, and the transcribed text is inserted at the cursor position -- replicating the desktop app's auto-paste UX within iOS sandboxing constraints.\n   468→\n   469→### Critical Constraint: No Microphone in Keyboard Extensions\n   470→\n   471→**iOS keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone.** This is an Apple restriction since iOS 8, unchanged through iOS 18/26. Even with `RequestsOpenAccess = true` and Full Access granted, `AVAudioSession`/`AVAudioRecorder` calls fail with error `561145187` from the keyboard extension process.\n   472→\n   473→**Every shipping voice keyboard** (Wispr Flow, Willow, Spokenly) works around this by recording audio in the main app process and communicating results back to the keyboard extension via App Groups.\n   474→\n   475→### Architecture\n   476→\n   477→```\n   478→┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   479→│              Main App (Expo/RN)                  │\n   480→│                                                  │\n   481→│  [Existing UI] [Settings] [Model Manager]        │\n   482→│                                                  │\n   483→│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │\n   484→│  │  BackgroundDictationService (NEW)          │  │\n   485→│  │  - AVAudioSession (background mode)        │  │\n   486→│  │  - Audio recording                         │  │\n   487→│  │  - WhisperKit transcription                │  │\n   488→│  │  - Cloud transcription fallback            │  │\n   489→│  │  - AI reasoning pipeline                   │  │\n   490→│  │  - Writes result → App Group               │  │\n   491→│  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │\n   492→│                                                  │\n   493→│  Storage: App Group UserDefaults + File Container│\n   494→│  Keychain: Shared access group for API keys      │\n   495→└──────────────┬───────────────────▲───────────────┘\n   496→               │ URL scheme        │ App Group\n   497→               │ deep link         │ shared data\n   498→               ▼                   │\n   499→┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n   500→│        Keyboard Extension (Native Swift)         │\n   501→│                                                  │\n   502→│  [SwiftUI UI: mic button + status + globe key]   │\n   503→│  [UITextDocumentProxy: text insertion]            │\n   504→│  [App Group reader: settings, transcriptions]     │\n   505→│  [URL scheme launcher: opens main app]            │\n   506→│  [Darwin notification observer: real-time IPC]    │\n   507→│                                                  │\n   508→│  Memory budget: ~8-15 MB / ~48-70 MB limit       │\n   509→└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n   510→```\n   511→\n   512→### Key Technical Decisions\n   513→\n   514→| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\n   515→|----------|--------|-----------|\n   516→| **Extension UI framework** | Native Swift + SwiftUI | React Native runtime (~30-40 MB) exceeds extension memory budget (~48-70 MB). RN team closed this as \"not planned\" ([#31910](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)). |\n   517→| **Xcode target setup** | `@bacons/apple-targets` | Supports `keyboard` type natively, auto-mirrors App Group entitlements, shared code via `targets/_shared/`, active maintenance. Requires Expo SDK 53+. |\n   518→| **Data sharing** | App Group UserDefaults + shared file container | Standard iOS pattern for app-to-extension communication. `group.com.openwhispr.mobile` identifier. |\n   519→| **IPC mechanism** | Darwin notifications + App Group polling | `CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter` for real-time signals (recording start/stop), App Group UserDefaults polling (0.5s) for state/text transfer. More responsive than polling alone. |\n   520→| **Settings sharing** | Migrate MMKV to App Group path | MMKV supports custom directory via `path` parameter. One-line change in `src/storage/mmkv.ts`. No existing user base to migrate. |\n   521→| **API key sharing** | Shared Keychain access group | Add `keychain-access-groups` entitlement to both targets. `expo-secure-store` may need native override. |\n   522→| **WhisperKit location** | Main app only | Models require ~75MB+ memory at runtime. Extension memory limit makes in-extension inference impossible. |\n   523→| **Keyboard type** | Dictation-only (no QWERTY) | Full keyboard replacement is massive scope. Competitors (Willow) also use dictation-only approach. Users switch keyboards for typing. |\n   524→| **Recording flow** | Hybrid: background audio session + deep link fallback | First activation deep-links to main app to start background audio session. Subsequent dictations signal via Darwin notification without app switching. Falls back to deep link if session expires. |\n   525→| **Open Access** | `RequestsOpenAccess = true` | Required for App Group access, network (cloud transcription), and clipboard. Keyboard must also work in degraded mode without Full Access (shows setup instructions). |\n   526→\n   527→### Communication Protocol\n   528→\n   529→The keyboard extension and main app communicate via a structured JSON state machine in App Group UserDefaults:\n   530→\n   531→```swift\n   532→// Key: \"com.openwhispr.dictation_state\"\n   533→struct DictationState: Codable {\n   534→    let sessionId: String        // UUID per dictation\n   535→    let state: DictationPhase    // idle | start_requested | recording | transcribing | complete | error\n   536→    let text: String?            // Transcription result (when complete)\n   537→    let error: String?           // Error message (when error)\n   538→    let timestamp: TimeInterval  // For staleness detection\n   539→}\n   540→\n   541→enum DictationPhase: String, Codable {\n   542→    case idle\n   543→    case startRequested = \"start_requested\"\n   544→    case recording\n   545→    case transcribing\n   546→    case complete\n   547→    case error\n   548→}\n   549→```\n   550→\n   551→**State transitions:**\n   552→```\n   553→Keyboard                          Main App\n   554→   │                                 │\n   555→   ├── write(startRequested) ──────> │\n   556→   │   + Darwin notify               │\n   557→   │                                 ├── read startRequested\n   558→   │                                 ├── start AVAudioSession\n   559→   │                                 ├── write(recording)\n   560→   │ <── observe recording ──────────┤\n   561→   │   (show recording UI)           │\n   562→   │                                 │   ... user speaks ...\n   563→   │                                 │\n   564→   ├── write(startRequested.stop) ─> │  (or auto-stop on silence)\n   565→   │                                 ├── stop recording\n   566→   │                                 ├── write(transcribing)\n   567→   │ <── observe transcribing ───────┤\n   568→   │   (show spinner)                │\n   569→   │                                 ├── run WhisperKit / cloud\n   570→   │                                 ├── run AI reasoning (optional)\n   571→   │                                 ├── write(complete, text: \"...\")\n   572→   │ <── observe complete ───────────┤\n   573→   │   insert text via proxy         │\n   574→   │   write(idle)                   │\n   575→   └─────────────────────────────────┘\n   576→```\n   577→\n   578→**Race condition protection:** Each dictation uses a UUID `sessionId`. The keyboard only reads results matching its current session. Stale states (timestamp > 60s) are treated as `idle`.\n   579→\n   580→### User Flows\n   581→\n   582→**Flow A: First-time keyboard setup**\n   583→1. User completes main app onboarding\n   584→2. Onboarding step 6 (NEW): \"Set Up Keyboard\" with visual instructions\n   585→3. User goes to iOS Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > OpenWhispr Voice\n   586→4. User taps OpenWhispr Voice > enables \"Allow Full Access\"\n   587→5. User confirms Apple's Full Access warning dialog\n   588→\n   589→**Flow B: First dictation per session (deep link)**\n   590→1. User is in any app (Messages, Notes, etc.) with OpenWhispr keyboard active\n   591→2. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n   592→3. Keyboard writes `startRequested` + opens `openwhispr://dictate?session=<uuid>`\n   593→4. iOS switches to OpenWhispr main app\n   594→5. Main app starts background audio session + begins recording\n   595→6. User speaks, taps \"Done\" (or silence auto-stop after 3s / max 5 min)\n   596→7. Main app transcribes, writes `complete` + text to App Group\n   597→8. User taps \"Return\" button or swipes back to source app\n   598→9. Keyboard detects `complete`, inserts text via `textDocumentProxy.insertText()`\n   599→\n   600→**Flow C: Subsequent dictation (background session active)**\n   601→1. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n   602→2. Keyboard checks `backgroundSessionActive` flag in App Group\n   603→3. Flag is true → keyboard writes `startRequested` + sends Darwin notification\n   604→4. Main app (background) starts recording — yellow mic indicator in Dynamic Island\n   605→5. User speaks, taps stop in keyboard\n   606→6. Main app transcribes, writes result to App Group\n   607→7. Keyboard inserts text — **no app switching required**\n   608→\n   609→**Flow D: Full Access not enabled**\n   610→1. User switches to OpenWhispr keyboard\n   611→2. Keyboard checks `self.hasFullAccess` → false\n   612→3. Keyboard shows message: \"Enable Full Access to use voice dictation\" with instructions\n   613→4. Globe/Next Keyboard button still works for switching away\n   614→\n   615→**Flow E: No model downloaded (local mode)**\n   616→1. User taps dictate in keyboard\n   617→2. Keyboard opens main app via deep link\n   618→3. Main app detects no WhisperKit model → shows download prompt\n   619→4. User downloads model, returns to source app, tries again\n   620→\n   621→### Implementation Phases\n   622→\n   623→#### Phase 7A: Infrastructure & App Group Setup\n   624→\n   625→**Goal:** Migrate shared storage to App Group, configure Xcode targets, establish IPC foundation.\n   626→\n   627→**Tasks:**\n   628→- [ ] Add App Group entitlement (`group.com.openwhispr.mobile`) to main app via

MMKV\n   645→  export const storage = createMMKV({\n   646→    id: \"openwhispr-settings\",\n   647→    path: \"<app-group-container>/mmkv\",\n   648→  });\n   649→  ```\n   650→- [ ] Add shared Keychain access group entitlement for API key sharing\n   651→- [ ] Configure `app.json` `extra.eas.build.experimental.ios.appExtensions` for EAS credential management\n   652→- [ ] Add `openwhispr://dictate` deep link handler in expo-router (new `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` or handle in `_layout.tsx`)\n   653→- [ ] Create `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` stub (coordinates recording → transcription → App Group write)\n   654→- [ ] Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and verify two Xcode targets exist\n   655→- [ ] Verify App Group entitlements in both targets' `.entitlements` files\n   656→\n   657→**Files to create/modify:**\n   658→- `targets/keyboard/expo-target.config.js` (NEW)\n   659→- `targets/keyboard/Info.plist` (NEW)\n   660→-

Keyboard Extension UI (Native Swift)\n   671→\n   672→**Goal:** Build the keyboard extension UI in SwiftUI with all states, Full Access detection, and text insertion.\n   673→\n   674→**Tasks:**\n   675→- [ ] Implement `KeyboardViewController.swift` with SwiftUI hosting:\n   676→  - Microphone button (large, centered) with tap and long-press\n   677→  - \"Next Keyboard\" globe button (Apple requirement — `advanceToNextInputMode()`)\n   678→  - Status indicator: idle / recording (pulsing) / transcribing (spinner) / done (checkmark) / error (message)\n   679→  - Full Access detection (`hasFullAccess` check with setup guidance view)\n   680→  - Dark mode support via `traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`\n   681→  - Haptic feedback on button taps (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`)\n   682→- [ ] Implement App Group state observer:\n   683→  - 0.5s polling timer for `DictationState` changes in App Group UserDefaults\n   684→  - Darwin notification observer for real-time signals (`CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter`)\n   685→  - Session ID matching to prevent stale result insertion\n   686→- [ ] Implement text insertion via `UITextDocumentProxy`:\n   687→  - Smart whitespace: check `documentContextBeforeInput` — prepend space if last char isn't space/newline\n   688→  - Handle long text (insert in one call — `insertText()` handles this correctly)\n   689→- [ ] Implement URL scheme launcher:\n   690→  - `UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"openwhispr://dictate?session=\\(sessionId)\")!)`\n   691→  - Detect whether to deep-link (first use / session expired) or signal via Darwin notification (session active)\n   692→- [ ] Configure keyboard height via Auto Layout constraints (~200pt for dictation-only)\n   693→- [ ] Build and test on physical device (keyboard extensions don't work in simulator)\n   694→\n   695→**Files to create/modify:**\n   696→- `targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` (IMPLEMENT)\n   697→-

Phase 7C: Background Dictation Service (Main App)\n   702→\n   703→**Goal:** Implement the main app's background recording + transcription pipeline triggered by the keyboard extension.\n   704→\n   705→**Tasks:**\n   706→- [ ] Implement `BackgroundDictationService.ts` (or native Swift service):\n   707→  - Observe `DictationState.startRequested` in App Group (polling + Darwin notification)\n   708→  - Start `AVAudioSession` with `.playAndRecord` category and `.defaultToSpeaker` option\n   709→  - Configure background audio mode in `app.json`: `\"UIBackgroundModes\": [\"audio\"]`\n   710→  - Record audio using `expo-av` Recording API (16kHz mono WAV)\n   711→  - Implement silence detection: auto-stop after 3s below -40dB threshold\n   712→  - Implement max duration: auto-stop after 5 minutes\n   713→  - After recording stops: route through existing transcription pipeline (`useTranscription` logic)\n   714→  - Write `DictationState.complete` with transcribed text to App Group\n   715→  - Write `DictationState.error` with message on failure\n   716→  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = true` flag in App Group\n   717→  - Heartbeat: update `backgroundSessionLastPing` timestamp every 30s while session is alive\n   718→- [ ] Implement deep link handler in `app/dictate-bridge.tsx`:\n   719→  - Parse `session` parameter from URL\n   720→  - Start `BackgroundDictationService` with session ID\n   721→  - Show minimal recording UI (waveform + \"Done\" button + \"Return to app\" button)\n   722→  - After transcription complete: show \"Text ready — return to your app\" message\n   723→- [ ] Handle audio interruptions (phone call, Siri):\n   724→  - Stop recording, transcribe partial audio if > 1s\n   725→  - Write partial result with `wasPartial: true` flag\n   726→- [ ] Handle app termination:\n   727→  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = false` on `applicationWillTerminate`\n   728→  - Keyboard extension detects expired session, falls back to deep link\n   729→\n   730→**Files to create/modify:**\n   731→- `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` (IMPLEMENT)\n   732→- `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` (IMPLEMENT)\n   733→- `app.json` (MODIFY — `UIBackgroundModes: [\"audio\"]`)\n   734→- `src/hooks/useAudioRecording.ts` (MODIFY — add silence detection, max duration)\n   735→\n   736→#### Phase 7D: Settings Sync & Onboarding Integration\n   737→\n   738→**Goal:** Ensure settings, onboarding, and keyboard setup are fully integrated.\n   739→\n   740→**Tasks:**\n   741→- [ ] Verify MMKV reads/writes work from both main app and keyboard extension (App Group path)\n   742→- [ ] Add onboarding step 6: \"Set Up Keyboard\" (between Agent Naming and Complete):\n   743→  - Visual instructions with iOS Settings screenshots\n   744→  - Steps: Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New > OpenWhispr Voice > Allow Full Access\n   745→  - \"Skip for now\" option (keyboard setup can be done later from Settings)\n   746→- [ ] Add \"Keyboard Setup\" section to Settings screen (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`):\n   747→  - Detect if keyboard is installed (no reliable API — show setup instructions always)\n   748→  - Link to iOS keyboard settings (`UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"App-prefs:General&path=Keyboard\")!)`)\n   749→  - Full Access status check and guidance\n   750→- [ ] Update transcription database schema: add `source` column (`\"app\"` | `\"keyboard\"`)\n   751→- [ ] Update `transcriptionStore.ts` to include `source` field\n   752→- [ ] Update history screen to show source badge (app vs keyboard)\n   753→- [ ] Mirror custom dictionary from MMKV to App Group UserDefaults for keyboard access\n   754→- [ ] Test settings changes propagation: change language in main app → keyboard uses new language on next dictation\n   755→\n   756→**Files to create/modify:**\n   757→- `app/onboarding.tsx` (MODIFY — add keyboard setup step, TOTAL_STEPS = 6)\n   758→- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (MODIFY — add Keyboard Setup section)\n   759→- `src/storage/database.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` column migration)\n   760→- `src/stores/transcriptionStore.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` field)\n   761→-

prominent centered button on the dictation tab\n   962→- **Settings organization** -- follow the desktop's settings grouping (Profile, App, Speech, Intelligence, System)\n   963→- **Typography and spacing** -- maintain the same visual rhythm, adjusted for mobile touch targets (minimum 44pt)\n   964→\n   965→### Key Conventions from Skills\n   966→\n   967→- **Use `Pressable` over `TouchableOpacity`** -- better accessibility and hover support\n   968→- **Use `expo-image` over `Image`** -- built-in caching, blurhash placeholders\n   969→- **Use `borderCurve: 'continuous'` for rounded corners** -- iOS-native squircle look\n   970→- **Use `gap` for spacing** instead of margin on children\n   971→- **Wrap third-party components** in `src/components/ui/` for easy replacement\n   972→- **Zustand with selectors** for global state (prevents unnecessary re-renders)\n   973→- **Never use `inline styles` in list items** -- extract to `StyleSheet.create()`\n   974→- **Use

\"feat: Port OpenWhispr to iOS with React Native\"\ntype: feat\ndate: 2026-02-12\n---\n\n# feat: Port OpenWhispr to iOS with React Native\n\n## Overview\n\nPort the OpenWhispr desktop dictation app (Electron) to iOS as a React Native app with full feature parity. The iOS app will use WhisperKit for on-device speech-to-text (replacing whisper.cpp), Expo with development builds for the framework, and direct API calls for cloud transcription and AI reasoning providers.\n\nThe desktop app currently supports macOS, Windows, and Linux with features including local transcription (whisper.cpp, NVIDIA Parakeet), cloud transcription (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral), AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq), streaming transcription (Deepgram), transcription history (SQLite), custom dictionary, agent naming system, and clipboard auto-paste.\n\n### Project Directory Structure\n\n```\n/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/   # <-- 工作區根目錄 (React Native iOS 新專案)\n├── reference/                # 原始 desktop Electron 專案的完整複本 (唯讀參考)\n│   ├── src/                  #   desktop 原始碼 (components, hooks, helpers, services, models, etc.)\n│   ├── main.js               #   Electron 主程序\n│   ├── preload.js            #   Electron preload\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md             #   Desktop 技術文件\n│   └── ...                   #   其他 desktop 檔案\n├── docs/plans/               # 計畫文件\n├── app/                      # (待建立) Expo Router screens\n├── src/                      # (待建立) React Native 原始碼\n├── modules/                  # (待建立) Expo native modules (WhisperKit)\n└── ...\n```\n\n**Important:**\n- `reference/` 是 desktop 專案的唯讀參考，**不要修改**其中的檔案\n- 實作時應參考 `reference/src/` 中的邏輯和模式，轉換為 React Native 等效實作\n- 可直接複製並適配的檔案：`reference/src/models/modelRegistryData.json`、`reference/src/utils/languages.ts`\n\n## Problem Statement / Motivation\n\nOpenWhispr is a desktop-only dictation app. Users want to dictate on their iPhones -- the most common device they carry. Mobile dictation enables:\n\n- Dictation on the go (commute, meetings, walking)\n- Always-available speech-to-text without a laptop\n- On-device privacy via WhisperKit (Apple Neural Engine optimized)\n- Seamless access to the same AI reasoning features as desktop\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a **separate React Native iOS app** using **Expo SDK 52+** with development builds. Use **WhisperKit** for local transcription (Core ML optimized for Apple Silicon), bridged via a custom **Expo Module** written in Swift. Reuse the model registry JSON and API integration patterns from the desktop app.\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Desktop (Current) | iOS (Proposed) |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Framework** | Electron 36 + React 19 | React Native + Expo SDK 52+ |\n| **Local STT** | whisper.cpp binary | WhisperKit (Core ML, Neural Engine) |\n| **Audio Recording** | MediaRecorder API | expo-av (AVAudioRecorder) |\n| **Database** | better-sqlite3 | expo-sqlite + Drizzle ORM |\n| **Settings Storage** | localStorage | react-native-mmkv (sync, encrypted) |\n| **Secure Storage** | .env files | expo-secure-store (iOS Keychain) |\n| **State Management** | React Context + useSyncExternalStore | Zustand v5 |\n| **Clipboard** | AppleScript/PowerShell paste | expo-clipboard (copy only) |\n| **Routing** | URL-based (Electron windows) | expo-router v4 (file-based) |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui | NativeWind (Tailwind for RN) |\n| **AI API Calls** | IPC bridge (CORS workaround) | Direct fetch (no CORS in RN) |\n| **Process Model** | Main + Renderer (IPC) | Single JS thread + Native Modules |\n| **Audio Format Conversion** | FFmpeg (bundled) | AVAudioSession (native format) |\n\n### Key Architecture Differences from Desktop\n\n1. **No IPC bridge** -- React Native communicates with native modules directly via JSI\n2. **No CORS** -- All API calls (including Anthropic) can be made directly from JS\n3. **WhisperKit replaces whisper.cpp** -- Core ML optimized, runs on Apple Neural Engine\n4. **No FFmpeg needed** -- expo-av handles audio format natively\n5. **Clipboard is simpler** -- No platform-specific automation, just expo-clipboard\n6. **Single window** -- Tab navigation replaces dual-window architecture\n7. **MMKV replaces localStorage** -- Synchronous, encrypted, faster\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nopenwhispr-mobile/\n├── app/

Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 1: Foundation (Project Setup + Audio Recording)\n\n**Goal:** Working React Native app that records audio on iOS and plays it back.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Initialize Expo project with SDK 52+ (`npx create-expo-app openwhispr-mobile --template tabs`)\n- [x] Configure app.json: bundle ID, iOS deployment target 17.0+, microphone permissions, background audio mode\n- [x] Install core dependencies: expo-av, expo-clipboard, expo-secure-store, expo-sqlite, react-native-mmkv, zustand, expo-router, nativewind\n- [x] Set up file-based routing with expo-router v4 (tab layout: Dictate, History, Settings)\n- [x] Implement `useAudioRecording.ts` hook with expo-av:\n  - Record in 16kHz mono WAV format (required by WhisperKit)\n  - Audio level metering for visual feedback\n  - Handle iOS audio session configuration (category, mode, options)\n  - Handle audio interruptions (phone calls, Siri, other apps)\n  - Support background recording via UIBackgroundModes\n- [x] Build RecordButton component with recording states (idle, recording, processing)\n- [x] Implement basic dictation screen with record button and waveform visualizer\n- [x] Set up react-native-mmkv for settings storage\n- [x] Set up expo-secure-store for API key storage\n- [x] Implement `usePermissions.ts` hook (microphone permission check/request)\n- [ ] Run on physical iOS device to verify audio recording works\n\n**Deliverables:** App records audio, shows waveform, saves WAV file locally.\n\n#### Phase 2: WhisperKit Integration (Local Transcription)\n\n**Goal:** On-device speech-to-text using WhisperKit via custom Expo Module.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Create WhisperKit Expo Module (`npx create-expo-module modules/whisperkit --local`)\n- [x] Add WhisperKit Swift Package dependency via cocoapods-spm plugin in Podfile:\n  ```ruby\n  plugin \"cocoapods-spm\"\n  spm_pkg \"WhisperKit\",\n    :url => \"https://github.com/argmaxinc/WhisperKit.git\",\n    :version => \"0.9.0\",\n    :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n  ```\n- [x] Implement `WhisperKitModule.swift` with these bridged methods:\n  - `initialize(model: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Load WhisperKit with specified model\n  - `transcribe(audioPath: String, language: String?, prompt: String?) -> Promise<TranscriptionResult>` -- Transcribe audio file\n  - `downloadModel(name: String) -> Void` (with progress events) -- Download model from HuggingFace\n  - `deleteModel(name: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Delete downloaded model\n  - `getAvailableModels() -> Promise<[ModelInfo]>` -- List available models with sizes\n  - `getDownloadedModels() -> Promise<[String]>` -- List downloaded models\n  - `isModelDownloaded(name: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Check if model exists\n  - `getRecommendedModel() -> Promise<String>` -- WhisperKit's device-specific recommendation\n- [x] Implement model download with progress events (emit events from Swift to JS)\n- [x] Implement disk space check before model download\n- [ ] Handle cellular vs WiFi download policy (warn for downloads >100MB on cellular)\n- [x] Implement `useWhisperKit.ts` hook wrapping the native module\n- [x] Implement `WhisperKitService.ts` for the transcription pipeline:\n  - Receive audio file path from recording\n  - Pass to WhisperKit with language and custom dictionary prompt\n  - Return transcription text\n- [x] Build ModelPicker component (list models, download progress, delete, select)\n- [x] Store models in `Library/Application Support/whisperkit-models/` with `isExcludedFromBackup` flag\n- [ ] Test on multiple iPhone generations (iPhone 12, 14, 16) for performance\n- [ ] Implement device compatibility warnings for large models on older devices\n\n**Deliverables:** Record audio -> transcribe locally with WhisperKit -> display text.\n\n#### Phase 3: Cloud Transcription + AI Reasoning\n\n**Goal:** Cloud transcription (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral) and AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Implement `CloudTranscription.ts` service:\n  - OpenAI `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart/form-data upload)\n  - Groq `/v1/audio/transcriptions`\n  - Mistral (no CORS issues in RN, call directly)\n  - Support custom base URL for self-hosted endpoints\n- [x] Implement AI reasoning services (all direct fetch, no IPC needed):\n  - `OpenAIService.ts` -- Responses API (`/v1/responses`) with Chat Completions fallback\n  - `AnthropicService.ts` -- Messages API (`/v1/messages`) -- direct call (no CORS in RN)\n  - `GeminiService.ts` -- generateContent API\n  - `GroqService.ts` -- Chat Completions API\n- [x] Implement `ReasoningService.ts` -- agent detection + provider routing:\n  - Detect \"Hey [AgentName]\" patterns in transcribed text\n  - Route to configured AI provider\n  - Remove agent name from final output\n  - Use system prompt from `BaseReasoningService` patterns\n- [x] Implement `useTranscription.ts` orchestrator hook:\n  - Route to local (WhisperKit) or cloud based on settings\n  - Optionally pipe through AI reasoning\n  - Handle errors with user-friendly messages\n  - Track usage for OpenWhispr cloud users\n- [x] Copy `modelRegistryData.json` from desktop (cloud providers section)\n- [x] Implement `ModelRegistry.ts` wrapper for iOS (filter out desktop-only models)\n- [x] Build API key management settings screen (expo-secure-store)\n- [x] Build transcription mode selection UI (local vs cloud, model picker)\n- [x] Build AI reasoning configuration UI (provider, model, agent name)\n\n**Deliverables:** Full transcription pipeline working (local + cloud + AI enhancement).\n\n#### Phase 4: Data Layer + History\n\n**Goal:** SQLite database for transcription history, settings persistence.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Set up expo-sqlite with schema and migrations\n- [x] Define schema:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE TABLE transcriptions (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    text TEXT NOT NULL,\n    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    duration INTEGER,           -- recording duration in ms\n    model_used TEXT,            -- which model transcribed this\n    is_local INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- local vs cloud transcription\n    was_processed INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- AI reasoning applied\n    processing_method TEXT\n  );\n\n  CREATE TABLE custom_dictionary (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    word TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n  );\n  ```\n- [x] Implement database migrations (via expo-sqlite sync API)\n- [x] Build `transcriptionStore.ts` (Zustand) with reactive history list\n- [x] Build History screen: list of transcriptions with timestamps, search, swipe-to-delete\n- [x] Build transcription detail view: full text, copy button, share button, delete\n- [x] Build custom dictionary management UI (add/remove words)\n- [x] Sync custom dictionary between MMKV (fast access) and SQLite (persistent)\n- [x] Implement `appStore.ts` (Zustand) for recording/transcribing state\n\n**Deliverables:** Transcription history with search, custom dictionary management.\n\n#### Phase 5: Settings + Onboarding + Polish\n\n**Goal:** Complete settings interface, onboarding flow, and production polish.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Build settings hub with sections:\n  - **Transcription:** Engine selection (local/cloud), model picker, language\n  - **AI Models:** Reasoning provider, model selection, agent name\n  - **Dictionary:** Custom word management\n  - **API Keys:** Per-provider key management (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq)\n  - **Appearance:** Theme (light/dark/auto)\n  - **Privacy:** Telemetry toggle\n  - **Account:** Sign in/out, usage, billing (if OpenWhispr cloud)\n  - **About:** App version, licenses\n- [x] Build onboarding flow (5 screens):\n  1. Welcome + optional auth\n  2. Microphone permission request\n  3. Transcription setup (local/cloud + model download)\n  4. Agent naming\n  5. Setup complete\n- [x] Implement theme system (light/dark/auto) with NativeWind\n- [x] Add haptic feedback (expo-haptics) for record start/stop and transcription complete\n- [ ] Add audio cues for dictation start/stop (port sound files from desktop)\n- [x] Implement copy-to-clipboard for transcription results\n- [x] Implement iOS Share Sheet for transcription text\n- [ ] Handle edge cases:\n  - Audio interruptions (phone calls, Siri)\n  - Background app transitions during recording\n  - Low memory warnings during WhisperKit processing\n  - Network errors during cloud transcription\n  - Model download failures (resume, retry)\n  - Permission revocation (mic)\n  - Low battery / Low Power Mode warnings\n- [ ] Implement VoiceOver accessibility for all screens\n- [ ] Configure app icons and splash screen\n- [ ] Set up EAS Build for TestFlight distribution\n\n**Deliverables:** Production-ready app with complete UI, onboarding, and error handling.\n\n#### Phase 6: Authentication + Cloud Features (Optional for v1)\n\n**Goal:** OpenWhispr cloud integration for signed-in users.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement Neon Auth via expo-auth-session or expo-web-browser\n- [ ] Implement OpenWhispr cloud transcription (POST to `/api/transcribe`)\n- [ ] Implement OpenWhispr cloud reasoning (POST to `/api/reason`)\n- [ ] Implement usage tracking and limit warnings\n- [ ] Implement billing/upgrade flows (Stripe checkout via in-app browser)\n- [ ] Implement cloud backup for transcriptions (if enabled)\n\n**Deliverables:** Full cloud feature parity with desktop for signed-in users.\n\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\n\n### 1. whisper.rn (whisper.cpp binding) instead of WhisperKit\n\n**Pros:** Cross-platform (iOS + Android), same model format as desktop (GGML), mature library\n**Cons:** Not optimized for Apple Neural Engine, slower than WhisperKit on iOS, no Core ML acceleration\n**Decision:** Rejected. WhisperKit provides significantly better performance on iOS via Core ML and Neural Engine optimization. The user specifically requested WhisperKit.\n\n### 2. whisper-kit-expo (existing npm package) instead of custom Expo Module\n\n**Pros:** Ready-made, less native code to write\n**Cons:** Limited API surface (only `transcribe()` and `loadTranscriber()`), no model management APIs, unclear maintenance status, no streaming support, no progress events for model downloads\n**Decision:** Rejected for primary integration. May reference its cocoapods-spm setup pattern. Building a custom Expo Module gives full control over the WhisperKit API surface.\n\n### 3. Swift + SwiftUI instead of React Native\n\n**Pros:** Best iOS performance, native WhisperKit integration (no bridge), full platform API access\n**Cons:** No code sharing with desktop React codebase, new language for the team, longer development time for full feature set\n**Decision:** Rejected per user preference for React Native.\n\n### 4. Bare React Native (no Expo)\n\n**Pros:** Full native control from day one\n**Cons:** More complex build setup, manual native module linking, no OTA updates, harder upgrades\n**Decision:** Rejected. Expo SDK 52+ with development builds provides full native access while offering better DX (expo-router, config plugins, EAS Build).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe locally using WhisperKit on-device\n- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe via cloud providers (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral)\n- [ ] User can configure and use AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq)\n- [ ] User can name their agent and trigger AI processing with \"Hey [AgentName]\"\n- [ ] User can view, search, copy, share, and delete transcription history\n- [ ] User can manage custom dictionary words\n- [ ] User can download, select, and delete WhisperKit models\n- [ ] User can securely store and manage API keys for all providers\n- [ ] User can select from 58+ transcription languages\n- [ ] User completes onboarding flow on first launch\n- [ ] App works offline for local transcription (model pre-downloaded)\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] iOS deployment target: 17.0+\n- [ ] WhisperKit transcription completes in <5s for 30s audio on iPhone 14+\n- [ ] App launch to record-ready in <2s (model pre-loaded)\n- [ ] Memory usage stays under 1.5GB during transcription\n- [ ] API keys stored in iOS Keychain (not plain storage)\n- [ ] Audio recording at 16kHz mono WAV for WhisperKit compatibility\n- [ ] Microphone permission handled gracefully (request, denial, revocation)\n- [ ] VoiceOver accessible on all screens\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n- [ ] Tested on physical devices: iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 16 (minimum 3 generations)\n- [ ] All screens pass VoiceOver audit\n- [ ] No memory leaks during extended recording sessions\n- [ ] App Store review requirements met (privacy policy, usage descriptions)\n\n## Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n1. **Apple Developer Account** -- Required for physical device testing and App Store submission\n2. **WhisperKit v0.9+** -- Swift Package, MIT license\n3. **Expo SDK 52+** -- Framework with development builds\n4. **Physical iOS device** -- WhisperKit requires Neural Engine (Simulator insufficient for testing)\n5. **OpenWhispr cloud backend** -- For auth, cloud transcription, billing (if Phase 6 included)\n\n## Risk Analysis & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| WhisperKit Expo Module bridging complexity | Medium | High | Start with proof-of-concept in Phase 2; reference whisper-kit-expo's cocoapods-spm pattern |\n| Large model downloads fail on mobile networks | Medium | Medium | Implement resume/retry, cellular warnings, disk space checks, background URLSession downloads |\n| Memory pressure with large WhisperKit models | Medium | High | Filter models by device capability, implement memory monitoring, fallback to smaller model |\n| iOS background audio restrictions | Low | Medium | Use UIBackgroundModes audio, test extensively, document limitations |\n| App Store rejection (audio recording app) | Low | High | Include comprehensive privacy policy, proper NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, no unnecessary permissions |\n| WhisperKit API breaking changes | Low | Medium | Pin to specific version, test during upgrades |\n\n## Deferred to Future Versions\n\nThese features from the desktop app or iOS-specific enhancements are **not included in v1**:\n\n| Feature | Reason for Deferral |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Streaming transcription (Deepgram/AssemblyAI)** | Adds significant complexity; batch transcription covers core use case |\n| **Local LLM reasoning (llama.cpp)** | Resource-intensive on mobile; cloud reasoning available |\n| **NVIDIA Parakeet (sherpa-onnx)** | iOS-only app; WhisperKit provides superior iOS transcription |\n| **Keyboard extension** | Separate Xcode target; complex shared storage; v2 feature |\n| **Siri Shortcuts** | Nice-to-have; not core functionality |\n| **Live Activities / Dynamic Island** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n| **iOS Widget** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n| **Cross-platform data sync** | Requires backend changes; desktop and mobile are separate projects |\n| **iPad-optimized layout** | Universal app runs on iPad; dedicated layout is v2 |\n\n## Text Output Strategy (Critical UX Decision)\n\nThe desktop app's core value is auto-paste: record speech and it appears in whatever app you were using. **iOS sandboxing prevents this.**\n\n### v1 Approach: Copy + Share\n\n1. After transcription, text is displayed on screen\n2. **Copy button** -- copies text to iOS clipboard (one tap)\n3. **Share button** -- opens iOS Share Sheet (send to any app: Messages, Notes, Mail, etc.)\n4. **Auto-copy setting** -- optionally auto-copy to clipboard after every transcription\n\n### v2 Approach: Custom Keyboard Extension\n\nA keyboard extension would allow voice dictation directly within any text field in any app -- the closest analog to the desktop's auto-paste. This is the most impactful iOS-specific feature but requires a separate Xcode target and shared App Group storage.\n\n---\n\n## v2 Feature Plan: Custom Keyboard Extension\n\n### Overview\n\nBuild an iOS Custom Keyboard Extension that enables voice-to-text dictation directly within any text field in any app. The user switches to the OpenWhispr keyboard, taps a microphone button, speaks, and the transcribed text is inserted at the cursor position -- replicating the desktop app's auto-paste UX within iOS sandboxing constraints.\n\n### Critical Constraint: No Microphone in Keyboard Extensions\n\n**iOS keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone.** This is an Apple restriction since iOS 8, unchanged through iOS 18/26. Even with `RequestsOpenAccess = true` and Full Access granted, `AVAudioSession`/`AVAudioRecorder` calls fail with error `561145187` from the keyboard extension process.\n\n**Every shipping voice keyboard** (Wispr Flow, Willow, Spokenly) works around this by recording audio in the main app process and communicating results back to the keyboard extension via App Groups.\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              Main App (Expo/RN)                  │\n│                                                  │\n│  [Existing UI] [Settings] [Model Manager]        │\n│                                                  │\n│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │  BackgroundDictationService (NEW)          │  │\n│  │  - AVAudioSession (background mode)        │  │\n│  │  - Audio recording                         │  │\n│  │  - WhisperKit transcription                │  │\n│  │  - Cloud transcription fallback            │  │\n│  │  - AI reasoning pipeline                   │  │\n│  │  - Writes result → App Group               │  │\n│  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │\n│                                                  │\n│  Storage: App Group UserDefaults + File Container│\n│  Keychain: Shared access group for API keys      │\n└──────────────┬───────────────────▲───────────────┘\n               │ URL scheme        │ App Group\n               │ deep link         │ shared data\n               ▼                   │\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│        Keyboard Extension (Native Swift)         │\n│                                                  │\n│  [SwiftUI UI: mic button + status + globe key]   │\n│  [UITextDocumentProxy: text insertion]            │\n│  [App Group reader: settings, transcriptions]     │\n│  [URL scheme launcher: opens main app]            │\n│  [Darwin notification observer: real-time IPC]    │\n│                                                  │\n│  Memory budget: ~8-15 MB / ~48-70 MB limit       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Key Technical Decisions\n\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **Extension UI framework** | Native Swift + SwiftUI | React Native runtime (~30-40 MB) exceeds extension memory budget (~48-70 MB). RN team closed this as \"not planned\" ([#31910](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)). |\n| **Xcode target setup** | `@bacons/apple-targets` | Supports `keyboard` type natively, auto-mirrors App Group entitlements, shared code via `targets/_shared/`, active maintenance. Requires Expo SDK 53+. |\n| **Data sharing** | App Group UserDefaults + shared file container | Standard iOS pattern for app-to-extension communication. `group.com.openwhispr.mobile` identifier. |\n| **IPC mechanism** | Darwin notifications + App Group polling | `CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter` for real-time signals (recording start/stop), App Group UserDefaults polling (0.5s) for state/text transfer. More responsive than polling alone. |\n| **Settings sharing** | Migrate MMKV to App Group path | MMKV supports custom directory via `path` parameter. One-line change in `src/storage/mmkv.ts`. No existing user base to migrate. |\n| **API key sharing** | Shared Keychain access group | Add `keychain-access-groups` entitlement to both targets. `expo-secure-store` may need native override. |\n| **WhisperKit location** | Main app only | Models require ~75MB+ memory at runtime. Extension memory limit makes in-extension inference impossible. |\n| **Keyboard type** | Dictation-only (no QWERTY) | Full keyboard replacement is massive scope. Competitors (Willow) also use dictation-only approach. Users switch keyboards for typing. |\n| **Recording flow** | Hybrid: background audio session + deep link fallback | First activation deep-links to main app to start background audio session. Subsequent dictations signal via Darwin notification without app switching. Falls back to deep link if session expires. |\n| **Open Access** | `RequestsOpenAccess = true` | Required for App Group access, network (cloud transcription), and clipboard. Keyboard must also work in degraded mode without Full Access (shows setup instructions). |\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\nThe keyboard extension and main app communicate via a structured JSON state machine in App Group UserDefaults:\n\n```swift\n// Key: \"com.openwhispr.dictation_state\"\nstruct DictationState: Codable {\n    let sessionId: String        // UUID per dictation\n    let state: DictationPhase    // idle | start_requested | recording | transcribing | complete | error\n    let text: String?            // Transcription result (when complete)\n    let error: String?           // Error message (when error)\n    let timestamp: TimeInterval  // For staleness detection\n}\n\nenum DictationPhase: String, Codable {\n    case idle\n    case startRequested = \"start_requested\"\n    case recording\n    case transcribing\n    case complete\n    case error\n}\n```\n\n**State transitions:**\n```\nKeyboard                          Main App\n   │                                 │\n   ├── write(startRequested) ──────> │\n   │   + Darwin notify               │\n   │                                 ├── read startRequested\n   │                                 ├── start AVAudioSession\n   │                                 ├── write(recording)\n   │ <── observe recording ──────────┤\n   │   (show recording UI)           │\n   │                                 │   ... user speaks ...\n   │                                 │\n   ├── write(startRequested.stop) ─> │  (or auto-stop on silence)\n   │                                 ├── stop recording\n   │                                 ├── write(transcribing)\n   │ <── observe transcribing ───────┤\n   │   (show spinner)                │\n   │                                 ├── run WhisperKit / cloud\n   │                                 ├── run AI reasoning (optional)\n   │                                 ├── write(complete, text: \"...\")\n   │ <── observe complete ───────────┤\n   │   insert text via proxy         │\n   │   write(idle)                   │\n   └─────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Race condition protection:** Each dictation uses a UUID `sessionId`. The keyboard only reads results matching its current session. Stale states (timestamp > 60s) are treated as `idle`.\n\n### User Flows\n\n**Flow A: First-time keyboard setup**\n1. User completes main app onboarding\n2. Onboarding step 6 (NEW): \"Set Up Keyboard\" with visual instructions\n3. User goes to iOS Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > OpenWhispr Voice\n4. User taps OpenWhispr Voice > enables \"Allow Full Access\"\n5. User confirms Apple's Full Access warning dialog\n\n**Flow B: First dictation per session (deep link)**\n1. User is in any app (Messages, Notes, etc.) with OpenWhispr keyboard active\n2. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n3. Keyboard writes `startRequested` + opens `openwhispr://dictate?session=<uuid>`\n4. iOS switches to OpenWhispr main app\n5. Main app starts background audio session + begins recording\n6. User speaks, taps \"Done\" (or silence auto-stop after 3s / max 5 min)\n7. Main app transcribes, writes `complete` + text to App Group\n8. User taps \"Return\" button or swipes back to source app\n9. Keyboard detects `complete`, inserts text via `textDocumentProxy.insertText()`\n\n**Flow C: Subsequent dictation (background session active)**\n1. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n2. Keyboard checks `backgroundSessionActive` flag in App Group\n3. Flag is true → keyboard writes `startRequested` + sends Darwin notification\n4. Main app (background) starts recording — yellow mic indicator in Dynamic Island\n5. User speaks, taps stop in keyboard\n6. Main app transcribes, writes result to App Group\n7. Keyboard inserts text — **no app switching required**\n\n**Flow D: Full Access not enabled**\n1. User switches to OpenWhispr keyboard\n2. Keyboard checks `self.hasFullAccess` → false\n3. Keyboard shows message: \"Enable Full Access to use voice dictation\" with instructions\n4. Globe/Next Keyboard button still works for switching away\n\n**Flow E: No model downloaded (local mode)**\n1. User taps dictate in keyboard\n2. Keyboard opens main app via deep link\n3. Main app detects no WhisperKit model → shows download prompt\n4. User downloads model, returns to source app, tries again\n\n### Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 7A: Infrastructure & App Group Setup\n\n**Goal:** Migrate shared storage to App Group, configure Xcode targets, establish IPC foundation.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Add App Group entitlement (`group.com.openwhispr.mobile`) to main app via `app.json` `ios.entitlements`\n- [ ] Install `@bacons/apple-targets` (`npx expo install @bacons/apple-targets`)\n- [ ] Create `targets/keyboard/` directory structure:\n  ```\n  targets/\n    keyboard/\n      expo-target.config.js    # type: \"keyboard\", entitlements, deployment target\n      Info.plist               # NSExtension config, RequestsOpenAccess, PrimaryLanguage\n      KeyboardViewController.swift  # Minimal UIInputViewController stub\n    _shared/\n      AppGroupStorage.swift    # Shared UserDefaults + file container helpers\n      DictationState.swift     # State machine types (DictationState, DictationPhase)\n      Constants.swift          # App Group ID, Darwin notification names, keys\n  ```\n- [ ] Migrate MMKV storage to App Group container path in `src/storage/mmkv.ts`:\n  ```typescript\n  // Use expo-file-system to resolve App Group path, pass to MMKV\n  export const storage = createMMKV({\n    id: \"openwhispr-settings\",\n    path: \"<app-group-container>/mmkv\",\n  });\n  ```\n- [ ] Add shared Keychain access group entitlement for API key sharing\n- [ ] Configure `app.json` `extra.eas.build.experimental.ios.appExtensions` for EAS credential management\n- [ ] Add `openwhispr://dictate` deep link handler in expo-router (new `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` or handle in `_layout.tsx`)\n- [ ] Create `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` stub (coordinates recording → transcription → App Group write)\n- [ ] Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and verify two Xcode targets exist\n- [ ] Verify App Group entitlements in both targets' `.entitlements` files\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `targets/keyboard/expo-target.config.js` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Info.plist` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` (NEW — stub)\n- `targets/_shared/AppGroupStorage.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/_shared/DictationState.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/_shared/Constants.swift` (NEW)\n- `src/storage/mmkv.ts` (MODIFY — App Group path)\n- `src/storage/secureStorage.ts` (MODIFY — shared Keychain access group)\n- `app.json` (MODIFY — entitlements, appExtensions)\n- `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` (NEW — deep link handler)\n- `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` (NEW — stub)\n\n#### Phase 7B: Keyboard Extension UI (Native Swift)\n\n**Goal:** Build the keyboard extension UI in SwiftUI with all states, Full Access detection, and text insertion.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement `KeyboardViewController.swift` with SwiftUI hosting:\n  - Microphone button (large, centered) with tap and long-press\n  - \"Next Keyboard\" globe button (Apple requirement — `advanceToNextInputMode()`)\n  - Status indicator: idle / recording (pulsing) / transcribing (spinner) / done (checkmark) / error (message)\n  - Full Access detection (`hasFullAccess` check with setup guidance view)\n  - Dark mode support via `traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`\n  - Haptic feedback on button taps (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`)\n- [ ] Implement App Group state observer:\n  - 0.5s polling timer for `DictationState` changes in App Group UserDefaults\n  - Darwin notification observer for real-time signals (`CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter`)\n  - Session ID matching to prevent stale result insertion\n- [ ] Implement text insertion via `UITextDocumentProxy`:\n  - Smart whitespace: check `documentContextBeforeInput` — prepend space if last char isn't space/newline\n  - Handle long text (insert in one call — `insertText()` handles this correctly)\n- [ ] Implement URL scheme launcher:\n  - `UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"openwhispr://dictate?session=\\(sessionId)\")!)`\n  - Detect whether to deep-link (first use / session expired) or signal via Darwin notification (session active)\n- [ ] Configure keyboard height via Auto Layout constraints (~200pt for dictation-only)\n- [ ] Build and test on physical device (keyboard extensions don't work in simulator)\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/DictationButton.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/StatusView.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/FullAccessGuide.swift` (NEW)\n\n#### Phase 7C: Background Dictation Service (Main App)\n\n**Goal:** Implement the main app's background recording + transcription pipeline triggered by the keyboard extension.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement `BackgroundDictationService.ts` (or native Swift service):\n  - Observe `DictationState.startRequested` in App Group (polling + Darwin notification)\n  - Start `AVAudioSession` with `.playAndRecord` category and `.defaultToSpeaker` option\n  - Configure background audio mode in `app.json`: `\"UIBackgroundModes\": [\"audio\"]`\n  - Record audio using `expo-av` Recording API (16kHz mono WAV)\n  - Implement silence detection: auto-stop after 3s below -40dB threshold\n  - Implement max duration: auto-stop after 5 minutes\n  - After recording stops: route through existing transcription pipeline (`useTranscription` logic)\n  - Write `DictationState.complete` with transcribed text to App Group\n  - Write `DictationState.error` with message on failure\n  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = true` flag in App Group\n  - Heartbeat: update `backgroundSessionLastPing` timestamp every 30s while session is alive\n- [ ] Implement deep link handler in `app/dictate-bridge.tsx`:\n  - Parse `session` parameter from URL\n  - Start `BackgroundDictationService` with session ID\n  - Show minimal recording UI (waveform + \"Done\" button + \"Return to app\" button)\n  - After transcription complete: show \"Text ready — return to your app\" message\n- [ ] Handle audio interruptions (phone call, Siri):\n  - Stop recording, transcribe partial audio if > 1s\n  - Write partial result with `wasPartial: true` flag\n- [ ] Handle app termination:\n  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = false` on `applicationWillTerminate`\n  - Keyboard extension detects expired session, falls back to deep link\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `app.json` (MODIFY — `UIBackgroundModes: [\"audio\"]`)\n- `src/hooks/useAudioRecording.ts` (MODIFY — add silence detection, max duration)\n\n#### Phase 7D: Settings Sync & Onboarding Integration\n\n**Goal:** Ensure settings, onboarding, and keyboard setup are fully integrated.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Verify MMKV reads/writes work from both main app and keyboard extension (App Group path)\n- [ ] Add onboarding step 6: \"Set Up Keyboard\" (between Agent Naming and Complete):\n  - Visual instructions with iOS Settings screenshots\n  - Steps: Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New > OpenWhispr Voice > Allow Full Access\n  - \"Skip for now\" option (keyboard setup can be done later from Settings)\n- [ ] Add \"Keyboard Setup\" section to Settings screen (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`):\n  - Detect if keyboard is installed (no reliable API — show setup instructions always)\n  - Link to iOS keyboard settings (`UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"App-prefs:General&path=Keyboard\")!)`)\n  - Full Access status check and guidance\n- [ ] Update transcription database schema: add `source` column (`\"app\"` | `\"keyboard\"`)\n- [ ] Update `transcriptionStore.ts` to include `source` field\n- [ ] Update history screen to show source badge (app vs keyboard)\n- [ ] Mirror custom dictionary from MMKV to App Group UserDefaults for keyboard access\n- [ ] Test settings changes propagation: change language in main app → keyboard uses new language on next dictation\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `app/onboarding.tsx` (MODIFY — add keyboard setup step, TOTAL_STEPS = 6)\n- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (MODIFY — add Keyboard Setup section)\n- `src/storage/database.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` column migration)\n- `src/stores/transcriptionStore.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` field)\n- `app/(tabs)/history.tsx` (MODIFY — source badge)\n\n#### Phase 7E: Testing, Polish & Edge Cases\n\n**Goal:** Comprehensive testing on physical devices, edge case handling, App Store readiness.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Test on physical iPhone (keyboard extensions don't work in simulator)\n- [ ] Test first-time flow: install → onboard → add keyboard → enable Full Access → dictate\n- [ ] Test repeated dictation: dictate → insert → dictate again → insert (no stale results)\n- [ ] Test background session flow: deep-link once → subsequent dictations without app switching\n- [ ] Test background session expiration: force-kill main app → keyboard falls back to deep link\n- [ ] Test cloud transcription from keyboard (requires network + API key)\n- [ ] Test AI reasoning from keyboard (agent name detection + cleanup)\n- [ ] Test offline + local mode (WhisperKit only, no network needed)\n- [ ] Test offline + cloud mode (should show clear error in keyboard)\n- [ ] Test audio interruption: phone call during recording → partial transcription\n- [ ] Test secure text fields: iOS replaces custom keyboard → no action needed\n- [ ] Test Full Access not granted: degraded mode shows setup instructions\n- [ ] Test memory usage: keyboard extension stays under 30 MB (profile with Instruments)\n- [ ] Test iPad: keyboard appears and functions correctly\n- [ ] Test Dark Mode in keyboard extension\n- [ ] Test VoiceOver accessibility in keyboard extension\n- [ ] Add privacy policy explaining Full Access data usage (required for App Review)\n- [ ] Test EAS Build with extension target included\n- [ ] Test TestFlight distribution with keyboard extension\n\n**Deliverables:** Production-ready keyboard extension with robust error handling and all edge cases covered.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n#### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] User can add OpenWhispr keyboard from iOS Settings\n- [ ] User can enable Full Access for the keyboard\n- [ ] User can switch to OpenWhispr keyboard in any text field\n- [ ] Tapping dictation button triggers recording (via main app)\n- [ ] Transcribed text is inserted at cursor position in the host app\n- [ ] Smart whitespace insertion (prepend space when needed)\n- [ ] Background session flow works without app switching (after first activation)\n- [ ] Settings (language, model, local/cloud) are shared between app and extension\n- [ ] API keys are accessible to main app from keyboard-triggered dictation\n- [ ] Custom dictionary is applied to keyboard-triggered transcriptions\n- [ ] AI reasoning works for keyboard-triggered dictations\n- [ ] Transcription history records keyboard-originated entries with `source: \"keyboard\"`\n- [ ] Keyboard shows clear status: idle, recording, transcribing, done, error\n- [ ] Keyboard shows setup guidance when Full Access is not enabled\n- [ ] Keyboard supports Dark Mode\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Keyboard extension memory usage < 30 MB\n- [ ] Keyboard appears in < 200ms (no React Native runtime)\n- [ ] Text insertion latency < 100ms after transcription complete\n- [ ] Background audio session survives app backgrounding for at least 10 minutes\n- [ ] Graceful degradation on audio interruption (partial transcription)\n\n### Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n| Dependency | Status | Notes

guide, FAQs |\n\n### Future Enhancements (Post-v2)\n\n- **Apple SpeechAnalyzer (iOS 26+):** System-managed on-device speech recognition with zero app memory overhead. [Argmax is integrating with WhisperKit](https://www.argmaxinc.com/blog/apple-and-argmax). Could enable in-extension transcription.\n- **Full QWERTY keyboard layout:** Add typing capability alongside dictation. Consider [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) open-source library.\n- **Siri Shortcuts integration:** Trigger dictation via Action Button or Back Tap without opening the keyboard.\n- **Live Activities / Dynamic Island:** Show recording status in Dynamic Island while recording in background.\n- **Streaming transcription:** Use Deepgram/AssemblyAI for real-time word-by-word insertion as user speaks.\n- **Clipboard-based fallback (Spokenly pattern):** For users who don't want a custom keyboard — dictate in app, auto-copy to clipboard.\n\n### References\n\n#### Apple Documentation\n- [Custom Keyboard Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html)\n- [Creating a Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/creating-a-custom-keyboard)\n- [Configuring Open Access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/configuring-open-access-for-a-custom-keyboard)\n- [UITextDocumentProxy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextdocumentproxy)\n- [SpeechAnalyzer (iOS 26)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer)\n\n#### Packages & Libraries\n- [@bacons/apple-targets](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets) — Expo plugin for adding Apple extension targets\n- [expo-keyboard-extension](https://github.com/cmaycumber/expo-keyboard-extension) — React Native keyboard extension (reference only)\n- [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) — Open-source Swift keyboard framework\n\n#### Competitor Analysis\n- [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai) — \"Flow Session\" background audio pattern\n- [Willow Voice](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/willows-voice-keyboard-lets-you-type-across-all-your-ios-apps-and-actually-edit-what-you-said/) — App-switch pattern (YC W25)\n- [Spokenly](https://spokenly.app/docs/ios/clipboard-dictation) — Shortcuts + clipboard pattern (on-device WhisperKit)\n\n#### Technical References\n- [React Native Keyboard Extension Memory Issue #31910](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)\n- [Argmax: Apple SpeechAnalyzer + WhisperKit](https://www.argmaxinc.com/blog/apple-and-argmax)\n- [iOS App Extensions Data Sharing](https://dmtopolog.com/ios-app-extensions-data-sharing/)\n- [Expo iOS App Extensions Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/app-extensions/)\n\n### How to Invoke\n\n```bash\n# Phase 7A: Infrastructure\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7A: App Group setup, @bacons/apple-targets, MMKV migration, keyboard target scaffold\"\n\n# Phase 7B: Keyboard UI\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7B: Native Swift keyboard extension UI with dictation button, status, text insertion\"\n\n# Phase 7C: Background Dictation\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7C: BackgroundDictationService, deep link handler, audio recording, transcription pipeline\"\n\n# Phase 7D: Settings & Onboarding\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7D: Settings sync, onboarding keyboard step, database source column, history badges\"\n\n# Phase 7E: Testing & Polish\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7E: Physical device testing, edge cases, memory profiling, App Store readiness\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Development Skills Reference\n\nDuring implementation, developers **must** consult the following skills in `.agents/skills/` for best practices and conventions:\n\n| Skill | Path | When to Use |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| **Vercel React Native Skills** | `.agents/skills/vercel-react-native-skills/` | All React Native development: component patterns, performance optimization (FlashList/LegendList), animation (Reanimated), state management (Zustand), styling conventions, expo-image, native module integration, React Compiler compatibility |\n| **Vercel React Best Practices** | `.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/` | General React patterns: hooks, context, rendering optimization, code splitting, error boundaries, data fetching patterns |\n| **Vercel Composition Patterns** | `.agents/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/` | Component architecture: avoiding boolean prop proliferation, building flexible/composable components, slot patterns, compound components, render delegation |\n| **Web Design Guidelines** | `.agents/skills/web-design-guidelines/` | UI/UX review: accessibility compliance, interaction patterns, visual design consistency |\n| **UI/UX Pro Max** | `/ui-ux-pro-max` skill | Overall UI/UX experience optimization: 50 design styles, 21 color palettes, 50 font pairings, chart patterns, and multi-framework stacks.

Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Research document** (`2026-02-12-research-ios-keyboard-extension.md`): This is a research document covering:\n   - Apple Keyboard Extension Architecture\n   - Expo Config Plugin Patterns\n   - @bacons/apple-targets\n   - WhisperKit SPM Integration (shared dependency)\n   - App Groups Entitlement via Config Plugin\n   - Shared Frameworks\n   - EAS Build Considerations\n   - Microphone Access Workarounds\n   - Recommended Implementation Approach\n\n2. **Main plan** (`2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md`): This is the comprehensive plan with Phases 1-7E, where Phase 7 (v2) is the keyboard extension.\n   \nLooking at the technical decisions, both documents align on using @bacons/apple-targets with SDK 53+ and the keyboard target type, and they both recognize that keyboard extensions can't access the microphone directly, so they recommend the same hybrid approach combining background audio with a deep link fallback.\n\nWhisperKit placement is consistent too—the research document rules it out for the extension due to memory constraints, and the plan correctly places it in the main app only. App Groups configuration matches across both documents using the same identifier, and the extension UI framework decision is aligned: native Swift with SwiftUI, explicitly avoiding React Native in the extension.\n\nFor the shared code structure, both recommend the same `targets/_shared/` directory pattern with the apple-targets setup. The communication protocol shows the plan is actually more refined than the research—while the research mentions basic UserDefaults polling and Darwin notifications in passing, the plan develops this into a structured state machine with JSON serialization, session UUIDs, and a more robust notification system. That's a natural extension of the research rather than a divergence. EAS Build configuration also lines up, with the plan's Phase 7A matching the research's `appExtensions` setup in app.json.\n\nNow looking at the memory constraints, there's a slight discrepancy in the numbers—the research cites 30-48 MB from a React Native issue, but the plan frames it as 48-70 MB with a target usage of 8-15 MB. The keyboard implementation is straightforward: the research shows a basic dictation button setup, and the plan explicitly commits to a dictation-only keyboard without QWERTY, which is a clear design decision. Open Access also aligns—both reference `RequestsOpenAccess = YES`, though the plan adds explicit reasoning for why it's needed.\n\nMoving into the technical architecture, the deep link scheme extends naturally from research to plan: the research documents `openwhispr://dictate`, and the plan adds a session UUID parameter for better state tracking. The IPC mechanism shows the plan building on the foundation—research mentions basic UserDefaults polling at 0.5s intervals plus URL scheme, while the plan layers in Darwin notifications and a session-based state machine for more robust inter-process communication. MMKV configuration is similarly aligned, with the plan providing concrete implementation details about migrating to the App Group path that the research only hints at.\n\nFor Keychain access, the research doesn't explicitly call out API key sharing, but the plan's approach of adding a shared Keychain access group entitlement fills that gap without contradicting anything. Looking at the discrepancies between research and plan: memory limits show some variance (research cites 30-48 MB, plan mentions 48-70 MB, though the acceptance criteria is more conservative at under 30 MB), the Expo SDK version differs slightly (research confirms 54 is current while plan specifies 52+), and WhisperKit shows a minor version gap (research has 0.9.4 versus plan's 0.9.0). These aren't conflicts so much as the plan being written before the research was finalized.\n\nThe research doesn't dive into Darwin notifications, the state machine structure, session IDs, silence detection, MMKV migration, or Keychain sharing specifics—all areas the plan addresses in detail. Meanwhile, the research covers the `expo-keyboard-extension` package and detailed Podfile and SPM integration patterns that the plan only touches on briefly. Overall, the two documents align well with the research validating the plan's architectural choices, though I should update those version numbers to match what the research found.","signature":"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

Let me provide the alignment analysis.\n\n## Alignment Analysis: Research vs. Main Plan\n\nThe two documents are **well-aligned** on all major architectural decisions. The research validates and provides deeper technical evidence for the plan's Phase 7 (v2 Keyboard Extension). Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Fully Aligned\n\n| Topic | Research | Plan (Phase 7) | Status |\n|-------|----------|----------------|--------|\n| **No microphone in extension** | Section 1 & 8: permanent Apple restriction | Critical Constraint section: same understanding | Aligned |\n| **@bacons/apple-targets** | Section 3: SDK 53+, `keyboard` type supported | Phase 7A: same package, same setup | Aligned |\n| **WhisperKit in main app only** | Section 4 Option D: memory analysis (105+ MB vs 48 MB limit) | \"WhisperKit location: Main app only\" | Aligned |\n| **App Group identifier** | `group.com.openwhispr.mobile` | Same identifier throughout | Aligned |\n| **Native Swift UI** | Section 9: `UIInputViewController` | \"Native Swift + SwiftUI\" (rejects RN runtime) | Aligned |\n| **Shared code via `_shared/`** | Section 6 Approach B | `targets/_shared/AppGroupStorage.swift` etc. | Aligned |\n| **Deep link scheme** | `openwhispr://dictate` | `openwhispr://dictate?session=<uuid>` (extends) | Aligned |\n| **Background audio session** | Section 8 Workaround A (Willow approach) | Hybrid Flow B/C: same pattern | Aligned |\n| **EAS appExtensions** | Section 7: credential management | Phase 7A: same config | Aligned |\n| **RequestsOpenAccess** | Section 1: YES for App Group/network | Same, with reasoning | Aligned |\n| **UserDefaults polling** | Section 9: 0.5s timer | Same 0.5s interval + Darwin notifications | Aligned |\n\n### Plan Extends Research (No Conflict)\n\nThe plan adds detail that the research doesn't cover, which is expected:\n- **Structured `DictationState` state machine** with session UUIDs and race condition protection\n- **Darwin notifications** (`CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter`) for real-time IPC\n- **MMKV migration** to App Group path (concrete code)\n- **Shared Keychain access group** for API key sharing\n- **Silence detection** (3s / -40dB) and max duration (5 min)\n- **Heartbeat mechanism** (30s ping for session liveness)\n- **5 detailed user flows** (A-E)\n\n### Minor Discrepancies to Fix\n\n| Item | Research | Plan | Recommendation |\n|------|----------|------|----------------|\n| **Extension memory limit** | ~30-48 MB (from RN issue #31910) | ~48-70 MB limit | Research's 30-48 MB is the commonly cited range. Plan should use conservative 48 MB as limit, 30 MB as target (which matches plan's acceptance criteria of < 30 MB). |\n| **WhisperKit version** | `0.9.4` | `0.9.0` | Update plan Phase 2 to `0.9.4` to match research's finding |\n| **Expo SDK** | \"Expo SDK 54\" (current project) | \"Expo SDK 52+\" (requirement) | Not a conflict - research confirms SDK 54 meets the 53+ minimum. No change needed. |\n\n### Research Provides Deeper Evidence For\n\nThese sections in the research give valuable background that strengthens the plan's decisions:\n1. **Section 2** (Expo Config Plugin Patterns) - detailed `withXcodeProject` patterns the plan will use\n2. **Section 3** (@bacons/apple-targets) - `pods.rb`, CocoaPods integration details\n3. **Section 4** (WhisperKit SPM Integration) - evaluates 4 options, concludes with Option D (matches plan)\n4. **Section 7** (EAS Build) - credential management edge cases, CocoaPods version requirement\n\n### Verdict\n\nThe research document solidly supports the plan's Phase 7 architecture. I recommend:\n\n1. **Update the WhisperKit version in the plan** from `0.9.0` to `0.9.4` (2 occurrences in Phase 2)\n2. **Cross-link the documents** - the research already references the plan at the bottom; the plan should reference the research in Phase 7's references\n3. No architectural changes needed - the decisions are consistent\n\nWould you like me to make these minor updates to bring them into perfect sync?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":33657,"cache_read_input_tokens":44505,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":33657},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY45kXAy7McBpaKRdmXgq","type":"assistant","uuid":"3ba1f03a-e8e6-489c-b120-9f1e90b4b926","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:19:15.733Z"}

This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.\n\n## Feature Description\n\n<feature_description> #/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/docs/plans/2026-02-12-research-ios-keyboard-extension.md </feature_description>\n\n**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** \"What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind.\"\n\nDo not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.\n\n### 0. Idea Refinement\n\n**Check for brainstorm output first:**\n\nBefore asking questions, look for recent brainstorm documents in `docs/brainstorms/` that match this feature:\n\n```bash\nls -la docs/brainstorms/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10\n```\n\n**Relevance criteria:** A brainstorm is relevant if:\n- The topic (from filename or YAML frontmatter) semantically matches the feature description\n- Created within the last 14 days\n- If multiple candidates match, use the most recent one\n\n**If a relevant brainstorm exists:**\n1. Read the brainstorm document\n2. Announce: \"Found brainstorm from [date]: [topic]. Using as context for planning.\"\n3. Extract key decisions, chosen approach, and open questions\n4. **Skip the idea refinement questions below** - the brainstorm already answered WHAT to build\n5. Use brainstorm decisions as input to the research phase\n\n**If multiple brainstorms could match:**\nUse **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask which brainstorm to use, or whether to proceed without one.\n\n**If no brainstorm found (or not relevant), run idea refinement:**\n\nRefine the idea through collaborative dialogue using the **AskUserQuestion tool**:\n\n- Ask questions one at a time to understand the idea fully\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when natural options exist\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints and success criteria\n- Continue until the idea is clear OR user says \"proceed\"\n\n**Gather signals for research decision.** During refinement, note:\n\n- **User's familiarity**: Do they know the codebase patterns? Are they pointing to examples?\n- **User's intent**: Speed vs thoroughness? Exploration vs execution?\n- **Topic risk**: Security, payments, external APIs warrant more caution\n- **Uncertainty level**: Is the approach clear or open-ended?\n\n**Skip option:** If the feature description is already detailed, offer:\n\"Your description is clear. Should I proceed with research, or would you like to refine it further?\"\n\n## Main Tasks\n\n### 1. Local Research (Always Runs - Parallel)\n\n<thinking>\nFirst, I need to understand the project's conventions, existing patterns, and any documented learnings. This is fast and local - it informs whether external research is needed.\n</thinking>\n\nRun these agents **in parallel** to gather local context:\n\n- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)\n- Task learnings-researcher(feature_description)\n\n**What to look for:**\n- **Repo research:** existing patterns, CLAUDE.md guidance, technology familiarity, pattern consistency\n- **Learnings:** documented solutions in `docs/solutions/` that might apply (gotchas, patterns, lessons learned)\n\nThese findings inform the next step.\n\n### 1.5. Research Decision\n\nBased on signals from Step 0 and findings from Step 1, decide on external research.\n\n**High-risk topics → always research.** Security, payments, external APIs, data privacy. The cost of missing something is too high. This takes precedence over speed signals.\n\n**Strong local context → skip external research.** Codebase has good patterns, CLAUDE.md has guidance, user knows what they want. External research adds little value.\n\n**Uncertainty or unfamiliar territory → research.** User is exploring, codebase has no examples, new technology. External perspective is valuable.\n\n**Announce the decision and proceed.** Brief explanation, then continue. User can redirect if needed.\n\nExamples:\n- \"Your codebase has solid patterns for this. Proceeding without external research.\"\n- \"This involves payment processing, so I'll research current best practices first.\"\n\n### 1.5b. External Research (Conditional)\n\n**Only run if Step 1.5 indicates external research is valuable.**\n\nRun these agents in parallel:\n\n- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)\n- Task framework-docs-researcher(feature_description)\n\n### 1.6. Consolidate Research\n\nAfter all research steps complete, consolidate findings:\n\n- Document relevant file paths from repo research (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)\n- **Include relevant institutional learnings** from `docs/solutions/` (key insights, gotchas to avoid)\n- Note external documentation URLs and best practices (if external research was done)\n- List related issues or PRs discovered\n- Capture CLAUDE.md conventions\n\n**Optional validation:** Briefly summarize findings and ask if anything looks off or missing before proceeding to planning.\n\n### 2. Issue Planning & Structure\n\n<thinking>\nThink like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives\n</thinking>\n\n**Title & Categorization:**\n\n- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`, `fix: Cart total calculation`)\n- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor\n- [ ] Convert title to filename: add today's date prefix, strip prefix colon, kebab-case, add `-plan` suffix\n  - Example: `feat: Add User Authentication` → `2026-01-21-feat-add-user-authentication-plan.md`\n  - Keep it descriptive (3-5 words after prefix) so plans are findable by context\n\n**Stakeholder Analysis:**\n\n- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)\n- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise\n\n**Content Planning:**\n\n- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience\n- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template\n- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)\n- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists\n\n### 3. SpecFlow Analysis\n\nAfter planning the issue structure, run SpecFlow Analyzer to validate and refine the feature specification:\n\n- Task spec-flow-analyzer(feature_description, research_findings)\n\n**SpecFlow Analyzer Output:**\n\n- [ ] Review SpecFlow analysis results\n- [ ] Incorporate any identified gaps or edge cases into the issue\n- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on SpecFlow findings\n\n### 4. Choose Implementation Detail Level\n\nSelect how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.\n\n#### 📄 MINIMAL (Quick Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Simple bugs, small improvements, clear features\n\n**Includes:**\n\n- Problem statement or feature description\n- Basic acceptance criteria\n- Essential context only\n\n**Structure:**\n\n````markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n[Brief problem/feature description]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Core requirement 1\n- [ ] Core requirement 2\n\n## Context\n\n[Any critical information]\n\n## MVP\n\n### test.rb\n\n```ruby\nclass Test\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"test\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Related issue: #[issue_number]\n- Documentation: [relevant_docs_url]\n````\n\n#### 📋 MORE (Standard Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Most features, complex bugs, team collaboration\n\n**Includes everything from MINIMAL plus:**\n\n- Detailed background and motivation\n- Technical considerations\n- Success metrics\n- Dependencies and risks\n- Basic implementation suggestions\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n## Overview\n\n[Comprehensive description]\n\n## Problem Statement / Motivation\n\n[Why this matters]\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n[High-level approach]\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Architecture impacts\n- Performance implications\n- Security considerations\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Detailed requirement 1\n- [ ] Detailed requirement 2\n- [ ] Testing requirements\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n[How we measure success]\n\n## Dependencies & Risks\n\n[What could block or complicate this]\n\n## References & Research\n\n- Similar implementations: [file_path:line_number]\n- Best practices: [documentation_url]\n- Related PRs: #[pr_number]\n```\n\n#### 📚 A LOT (Comprehensive Issue)\n\n**Best for:** Major features, architectural changes, complex integrations\n\n**Includes everything from MORE plus:**\n\n- Detailed implementation plan with phases\n- Alternative approaches considered\n- Extensive technical specifications\n- Resource requirements and timeline\n- Future considerations and extensibility\n- Risk mitigation strategies\n- Documentation requirements\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: [Issue Title]\ntype: [feat|fix|refactor]\ndate: YYYY-MM-DD\n---\n\n# [Issue Title]\n\n## Overview\n\n[Executive summary]\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n[Detailed problem analysis]\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n[Comprehensive solution design]\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n\n[Detailed technical design]\n\n### Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 1: [Foundation]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n#### Phase 2: [Core Implementation]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n#### Phase 3: [Polish & Optimization]\n\n- Tasks and deliverables\n- Success criteria\n- Estimated effort\n\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\n\n[Other solutions evaluated and why rejected]\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] Detailed functional criteria\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] Performance targets\n- [ ] Security requirements\n- [ ] Accessibility standards\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n- [ ] Test coverage requirements\n- [ ] Documentation completeness\n- [ ] Code review approval\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n[Detailed KPIs and measurement methods]\n\n## Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n[Detailed dependency analysis]\n\n## Risk Analysis & Mitigation\n\n[Comprehensive risk assessment]\n\n## Resource Requirements\n\n[Team, time, infrastructure needs]\n\n## Future Considerations\n\n[Extensibility and long-term vision]\n\n## Documentation Plan\n\n[What docs need updating]\n\n## References & Research\n\n### Internal References\n\n- Architecture decisions: [file_path:line_number]\n- Similar features: [file_path:line_number]\n- Configuration: [file_path:line_number]\n\n### External References\n\n- Framework documentation: [url]\n- Best practices guide: [url]\n- Industry standards: [url]\n\n### Related Work\n\n- Previous PRs: #[pr_numbers]\n- Related issues: #[issue_numbers]\n- Design documents: [links]\n```\n\n### 5. Issue Creation & Formatting\n\n<thinking>\nApply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand\n</thinking>\n\n**Content Formatting:**\n\n- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)\n- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting\n- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)\n- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off\n- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags\n- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)\n\n**Cross-Referencing:**\n\n- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format\n- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant\n- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)\n- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed\n- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text\n\n**Code & Examples:**\n\n````markdown\n# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references\n\n\n```ruby\n# app/services/user_service.rb:42\ndef process_user(user)\n\n# Implementation here\n\nend\n```\n\n# Collapsible error logs\n\n<details>\n<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>\n\n`Error details here...`\n\n</details>\n````\n\n**AI-Era Considerations:**\n\n- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming\n- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research\n- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)\n- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation\n- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review\n\n### 6. Final Review & Submission\n\n**Pre-submission Checklist:**\n\n- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive\n- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue\n- [ ] All template sections are complete\n- [ ] Links and references are working\n- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable\n- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists\n- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes\n\n## Output Format\n\n**Filename:** Use the date and kebab-case filename from Step 2 Title & Categorization.\n\n```\ndocs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<descriptive-name>-plan.md\n```\n\nExamples:\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-user-authentication-flow-plan.md`\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-02-03-fix-checkout-race-condition-plan.md`\n- ✅ `docs/plans/2026-03-10-refactor-api-client-extraction-plan.md`\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-thing-plan.md` (not descriptive - what \"thing\"?)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat-new-feature-plan.md` (too vague - what feature?)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/2026-01-15-feat: user auth-plan.md` (invalid characters - colon and space)\n- ❌ `docs/plans/feat-user-auth-plan.md` (missing date prefix)\n\n## Post-Generation Options\n\nAfter writing the plan file, use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to present these options:\n\n**Question:** \"Plan ready at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<name>-plan.md`. What would you like to do next?\"\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Open plan in editor** - Open the plan file for review\n2. **Run `/deepen-plan`** - Enhance each section with parallel research agents (best practices, performance, UI)\n3. **Run `/plan_review`** - Get feedback from reviewers (DHH, Kieran, Simplicity)\n4. **Start `/workflows:work`** - Begin implementing this plan locally\n5. **Start `/workflows:work` on remote** - Begin implementing in Claude Code on the web (use `&` to run in background)\n6. **Create Issue** - Create issue in project tracker (GitHub/Linear)\n7. **Simplify** - Reduce detail level\n\nBased on selection:\n- **Open plan in editor** → Run `open docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md` to open the file in the user's default editor\n- **`/deepen-plan`** → Call the /deepen-plan command with the plan file path to enhance with research\n- **`/plan_review`** → Call the /plan_review command with the plan file path\n- **`/workflows:work`** → Call the /workflows:work command with the plan file path\n- **`/workflows:work` on remote** → Run `/workflows:work docs/plans/<plan_filename>.md &` to start work in background for Claude Code web\n- **Create Issue** → See \"Issue Creation\" section below\n- **Simplify** → Ask \"What should I simplify?\" then regenerate simpler version\n- **Other** (automatically provided) → Accept free text for rework or specific changes\n\n**Note:** If running `/workflows:plan` with ultrathink enabled, automatically run `/deepen-plan` after plan creation for maximum depth and grounding.\n\nLoop back to options after Simplify or Other changes until user selects `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`.\n\n## Issue Creation\n\nWhen user selects \"Create Issue\", detect their project tracker from CLAUDE.md:\n\n1. **Check for tracker preference** in user's CLAUDE.md (global or project):\n   - Look for `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear`\n   - Or look for mentions of \"GitHub Issues\" or \"Linear\" in their workflow section\n\n2. **If GitHub:**\n\n   Use the title and type from Step 2 (already in context - no need to re-read the file):\n\n   ```bash\n   gh issue create --title \"<type>: <title>\" --body-file <plan_path>\n   ```\n\n3. **If Linear:**\n\n   ```bash\n   linear issue create --title \"<title>\" --description \"$(cat <plan_path>)\"\n   ```\n\n4. **If no tracker configured:**\n   Ask user: \"Which project tracker do you use? (GitHub/Linear/Other)\"\n   - Suggest adding `project_tracker: github` or `project_tracker: linear` to their CLAUDE.md\n\n5. **After creation:**\n   - Display the issue URL\n   - Ask if they want to proceed to `/workflows:work` or `/plan_review`\n\nNEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"ef276c7f-e89e-4add-b173-bfd5df8ed354","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:21:28.234Z"}

The research document already exists at `docs/plans/2026-02-12-research-ios-keyboard-extension.md` and covers the iOS keyboard extension research. The main plan already has Phase 7 (v2 Keyboard Extension) integrated into it at `docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md`.\n\nLooking at the workflow command, the user passed the research doc path as the feature description. They want me to turn this research into a proper implementation plan.\n\nBut wait - I just did an alignment analysis in the previous turn showing that the research and the main plan's Phase 7 are already well-aligned. \n\nNow the user is running `/workflows:plan` on the research document itself. They want me to create a standalone implementation plan from this research, but the main plan already has Phase 7A-7E covering the keyboard extension implementation in detail, so I need to figure out if they want a separate plan or if they're looking for something else entirely.\n\nThe research document is extremely detailed and serves as the feature description here. Rather than duplicating what's already in Phase 7, I should follow the workflow properly—checking for brainstorms first, assessing whether refinement is needed given how comprehensive the research already is, then deciding whether to create a standalone plan or suggest updates to the existing Phase 7 instead.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4306,"cache_read_input_tokens":80804,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4306},"output_tokens":11,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY46162neFJwcLgVAahfc","type":"assistant","uuid":"5997cb4a-0c1c-4e37-bd65-7f5a104589ff","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:21:47.121Z"}

The focus is on **shipping complete features** by understanding requirements quickly, following existing patterns, and maintaining quality throughout.\n\n## Input Document\n\n<input_document> #/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/docs/plans/2026-02-12-research-ios-keyboard-extension.md </input_document>\n\n## Execution Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Quick Start\n\n1. **Read Plan and Clarify**\n\n   - Read the work document completely\n   - Review any references or links provided in the plan\n   - If anything is unclear or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions now\n   - Get user approval to proceed\n   - **Do not skip this** - better to ask questions now than build the wrong thing\n\n2. **Setup Environment**\n\n   First, check the current branch:\n\n   ```bash\n   current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)\n   default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@')\n\n   # Fallback if remote HEAD isn't set\n   if [ -z \"$default_branch\" ]; then\n     default_branch=$(git rev-parse --verify origin/main >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo \"main\" || echo \"master\")\n   fi\n   ```\n\n   **If already on a feature branch** (not the default branch):\n   - Ask: \"Continue working on `[current_branch]`, or create a new branch?\"\n   - If continuing, proceed to step 3\n   - If creating new, follow Option A or B below\n\n   **If on the default branch**, choose how to proceed:\n\n   **Option A: Create a new branch**\n   ```bash\n   git pull origin [default_branch]\n   git checkout -b feature-branch-name\n   ```\n   Use a meaningful name based on the work (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`, `fix/email-validation`).\n\n   **Option B: Use a worktree (recommended for parallel development)**\n   ```bash\n   skill: git-worktree\n   # The skill will create a new branch from the default branch in an isolated worktree\n   ```\n\n   **Option C: Continue on the default branch**\n   - Requires explicit user confirmation\n   - Only proceed after user explicitly says \"yes, commit to [default_branch]\"\n   - Never commit directly to the default branch without explicit permission\n\n   **Recommendation**: Use worktree if:\n   - You want to work on multiple features simultaneously\n   - You want to keep the default branch clean while experimenting\n   - You plan to switch between branches frequently\n\n3. **Create Todo List**\n   - Use TodoWrite to break plan into actionable tasks\n   - Include dependencies between tasks\n   - Prioritize based on what needs to be done first\n   - Include testing and quality check tasks\n   - Keep tasks specific and completable\n\n### Phase 2: Execute\n\n1. **Task Execution Loop**\n\n   For each task in priority order:\n\n   ```\n   while (tasks remain):\n     - Mark task as in_progress in TodoWrite\n     - Read any referenced files from the plan\n     - Look for similar patterns in codebase\n     - Implement following existing conventions\n     - Write tests for new functionality\n     - Run tests after changes\n     - Mark task as completed in TodoWrite\n     - Mark off the corresponding checkbox in the plan file ([ ] → [x])\n     - Evaluate for incremental commit (see below)\n   ```\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Always update the original plan document by checking off completed items. Use the Edit tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for each task you finish. This keeps the plan as a living document showing progress and ensures no checkboxes are left unchecked.\n\n2. **Incremental Commits**\n\n   After completing each task, evaluate whether to create an incremental commit:\n\n   | Commit when... | Don't commit when... |\n   |----------------|---------------------|\n   | Logical unit complete (model, service, component) | Small part of a larger unit |\n   | Tests pass + meaningful progress | Tests failing |\n   | About to switch contexts (backend → frontend) | Purely scaffolding with no behavior |\n   | About to attempt risky/uncertain changes | Would need a \"WIP\" commit message |\n\n   **Heuristic:** \"Can I write a commit message that describes a complete, valuable change? If yes, commit. If the message would be 'WIP' or 'partial X', wait.\"\n\n   **Commit workflow:**\n   ```bash\n   # 1. Verify tests pass (use project's test command)\n   # Examples: bin/rails test, npm test, pytest, go test, etc.\n\n   # 2. Stage only files related to this logical unit (not `git add .`)\n   git add <files related to this logical unit>\n\n   # 3. Commit with conventional message\n   git commit -m \"feat(scope): description of this unit\"\n   ```\n\n   **Handling merge conflicts:** If conflicts arise during rebasing or merging, resolve them immediately. Incremental commits make conflict resolution easier since each commit is small and focused.\n\n   **Note:** Incremental commits use clean conventional messages without attribution footers. The final Phase 4 commit/PR includes the full attribution.\n\n3. **Follow Existing Patterns**\n\n   - The plan should reference similar code - read those files first\n   - Match naming conventions exactly\n   - Reuse existing components where possible\n   - Follow project coding standards (see CLAUDE.md)\n   - When in doubt, grep for similar implementations\n\n4. **Test Continuously**\n\n   - Run relevant tests after each significant change\n   - Don't wait until the end to test\n   - Fix failures immediately\n   - Add new tests for new functionality\n\n5. **Figma Design Sync** (if applicable)\n\n   For UI work with Figma designs:\n\n   - Implement components following design specs\n   - Use figma-design-sync agent iteratively to compare\n   - Fix visual differences identified\n   - Repeat until implementation matches design\n\n6. **Track Progress**\n   - Keep TodoWrite updated as you complete tasks\n   - Note any blockers or unexpected discoveries\n   - Create new tasks if scope expands\n   - Keep user informed of major milestones\n\n### Phase 3: Quality Check\n\n1. **Run Core Quality Checks**\n\n   Always run before submitting:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Run full test suite (use project's test command)\n   # Examples: bin/rails test, npm test, pytest, go test, etc.\n\n   # Run linting (per CLAUDE.md)\n   # Use linting-agent before pushing to origin\n   ```\n\n2. **Consider Reviewer Agents** (Optional)\n\n   Use for complex, risky, or large changes:\n\n   - **code-simplicity-reviewer**: Check for unnecessary complexity\n   - **kieran-rails-reviewer**: Verify Rails conventions (Rails projects)\n   - **performance-oracle**: Check for performance issues\n   - **security-sentinel**: Scan for security vulnerabilities\n   - **cora-test-reviewer**: Review test quality (Rails projects with comprehensive test coverage)\n\n   Run reviewers in parallel with Task tool:\n\n   ```\n   Task(code-simplicity-reviewer): \"Review changes for simplicity\"\n   Task(kieran-rails-reviewer): \"Check Rails conventions\"\n   ```\n\n   Present findings to user and address critical issues.\n\n3. **Final Validation**\n   - All TodoWrite tasks marked completed\n   - All tests pass\n   - Linting passes\n   - Code follows existing patterns\n   - Figma designs match (if applicable)\n   - No console errors or warnings\n\n### Phase 4: Ship It\n\n1. **Create Commit**\n\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git status  # Review what's being committed\n   git diff --staged  # Check the changes\n\n   # Commit with conventional format\n   git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   feat(scope): description of what and why\n\n   Brief explanation if needed.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Capture and Upload Screenshots for UI Changes** (REQUIRED for any UI work)\n\n   For **any** design changes, new views, or UI modifications, you MUST capture and upload screenshots:\n\n   **Step 1: Start dev server** (if not running)\n   ```bash\n   bin/dev  # Run in background\n   ```\n\n   **Step 2: Capture screenshots with agent-browser CLI**\n   ```bash\n   agent-browser open http://localhost:3000/[route]\n   agent-browser snapshot -i\n   agent-browser screenshot output.png\n   ```\n   See the `agent-browser` skill for detailed usage.\n\n   **Step 3: Upload using imgup skill**\n   ```bash\n   skill: imgup\n   # Then upload each screenshot:\n   imgup -h pixhost screenshot.png  # pixhost works without API key\n   # Alternative hosts: catbox, imagebin, beeimg\n   ```\n\n   **What to capture:**\n   - **New screens**: Screenshot of the new UI\n   - **Modified screens**: Before AND after screenshots\n   - **Design implementation**: Screenshot showing Figma design match\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Always include uploaded image URLs in PR description. This provides visual context for reviewers and documents the change.\n\n3. **Create Pull Request**\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin feature-branch-name\n\n   gh pr create --title \"Feature: [Description]\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   ## Summary\n   - What was built\n   - Why it was needed\n   - Key decisions made\n\n   ## Testing\n   - Tests added/modified\n   - Manual testing performed\n\n   ## Before / After Screenshots\n   | Before | After |\n   |--------|-------|\n   | ![before](URL) | ![after](URL) |\n\n   ## Figma Design\n   [Link if applicable]\n\n   ---\n\n   [![Compound Engineered](https://img.shields.io/badge/Compound-Engineered-6366f1)](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) 🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Notify User**\n   - Summarize what was completed\n   - Link to PR\n   - Note any follow-up work needed\n   - Suggest next steps if applicable\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n### Start Fast, Execute Faster\n\n- Get clarification once at the start, then execute\n- Don't wait for perfect understanding - ask questions and move\n- The goal is to **finish the feature**, not create perfect process\n\n### The Plan is Your Guide\n\n- Work documents should reference similar code and patterns\n- Load those references and follow them\n- Don't reinvent - match what exists\n\n### Test As You Go\n\n- Run tests after each change, not at the end\n- Fix failures immediately\n- Continuous testing prevents big surprises\n\n### Quality is Built In\n\n- Follow existing patterns\n- Write tests for new code\n- Run linting before pushing\n- Use reviewer agents for complex/risky changes only\n\n### Ship Complete Features\n\n- Mark all tasks completed before moving on\n- Don't leave features 80% done\n- A finished feature that ships beats a perfect feature that doesn't\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore creating PR, verify:\n\n- [ ] All clarifying questions asked and answered\n- [ ] All TodoWrite tasks marked completed\n- [ ] Tests pass (run project's test command)\n- [ ] Linting passes (use linting-agent)\n- [ ] Code follows existing patterns\n- [ ] Figma designs match implementation (if applicable)\n- [ ] Before/after screenshots captured and uploaded (for UI changes)\n- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format\n- [ ] PR description includes summary, testing notes, and screenshots\n- [ ] PR description includes Compound Engineered badge\n\n## When to Use Reviewer Agents\n\n**Don't use by default.** Use reviewer agents only when:\n\n- Large refactor affecting many files (10+)\n- Security-sensitive changes (authentication, permissions, data access)\n- Performance-critical code paths\n- Complex algorithms or business logic\n- User explicitly requests thorough review\n\nFor most features: tests + linting + following patterns is sufficient.\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Analysis paralysis** - Don't overthink, read the plan and execute\n- **Skipping clarifying questions** - Ask now, not after building wrong thing\n- **Ignoring plan references** - The plan has links for a reason\n- **Testing at the end** - Test continuously or suffer later\n- **Forgetting TodoWrite** - Track progress or lose track of what's done\n- **80% done syndrome** - Finish the feature, don't move on early\n- **Over-reviewing simple changes** - Save reviewer agents for complex work\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"fea5bc25-4b2a-4cfd-9ef9-9979eec8cbc2","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:23:52.877Z"}

Let me read it carefully first - I already have both documents in context from the previous turn.\n\nWait - the research document (`2026-02-12-research-ios-keyboard-extension.md`) is a **research document**, not an implementation plan. It documents findings about iOS keyboard extensions. The actual implementation plan is in the main plan's Phase 7A-7E.\n\nBut the user is asking me to work from the research document. The research document's Section 9 \"Recommended Implementation Approach\" does have implementation steps (Steps 1-7). Let me look at what's actionable there.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the research document, Section 9 has:\n\n\n- Step 1: Use @bacons/apple-targets\n- Step 2: Configure the Keyboard Target\n- Step 3: Add App Groups to Main App\n- Step 4: Implement Native Keyboard Extension (Swift)\n- Step 5: Shared Code via _shared Directory\n- Step 6: WhisperKit Stays in Main App Only\n- Step 7: Background Audio Session in Main App\n\nThe main plan has Phase 7A-7E which is much more detailed. Before I start implementing, I should follow the workflow: read the work document completely, review references, ask clarifying questions, and get user approval to proceed.\n\nI've already reviewed the plan and the research document's Section 9 has implementation steps, but I need to clarify whether to follow those steps or the more detailed Phase 7A-7E breakdown from the main plan.

Now I have a clear picture. The research document's Section 9 outlines the implementation approach. Let me map this to what needs to be done.\n\nThe research document essentially covers the technical foundation for Phase 7A of the main plan. Let me think about what exactly to implement.\n\nLooking at the research document Section 9 \"Recommended Implementation Approach\":\n- Step 1: Use @bacons/apple-targets\n- Step 2: Configure the Keyboard Target\n- Step 3: Add App Groups to Main App\n- Step 4: Implement Native Keyboard Extension (Swift)\n\n\n- Step 5: Shared Code via _shared Directory\n- Step 6: WhisperKit Stays in Main App Only\n- Step 7: Background Audio Session in Main App\n\nThis maps directly to Phase 7A (Infrastructure & App Group Setup). Now I need to start the implementation: install the package, set up the keyboard target directory with its config and Swift controller, create the shared directory for cross-target code, and update the main app accordingly.\n\nI'm realizing some of these steps require physical device testing to fully verify—the prebuild process and app group entitlements need actual compilation. Before diving in, I should clarify with the user whether they want me to proceed with the full Phase 7A implementation, since the research document is more of a technical specification than a step-by-step task list.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1348,"cache_read_input_tokens":99141,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1348},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CY46F3uC5hBYnVn6SLm7K","type":"assistant","uuid":"fd97d7f2-bd7a-48cf-9a17-511a02bae826","timestamp":"2026-02-12T11:24:56.577Z"}

Let me check the API. From the react-native-mmkv docs, the correct way to use App Groups is via the `path` parameter or the `appGroup` parameter. Let me check if there's a dedicated `appGroup` option in v4.\n\nActually, looking at the react-native-mmkv source code and docs for v4, there is a `mode` property and the way to use App Groups is:\n\n```javascript\nimport { MMKV, Mode } from 'react-native-mmkv'\n\nconst storage = new MMKV({\n  id: 'my-app-storage',\n  mode: Mode.MULTI_PROCESS,\n  path: '/path/to/app-group/container',\n})\n```\n\nWait, but we're using `createMMKV` from the library. Let me check what API is available. In newer versions of react-native-mmkv (v3+), the storage can be initialized with `new MMKV()` or the createMMKV wrapper, and the key parameter for App Groups is `path` for the container path rather than a direct `appGroup` property. I'm realizing that react-native-mmkv v3 might not have the exact API I'm thinking of.\n\nFor v4 specifically (which we're using at `^4.1.2`), the API supports App Groups through `mode: Mode.MULTI_PROCESS` and a `path` property pointing to the App Group container. The challenge is getting the actual filesystem path of the App Group container in React Native without a native module, though `expo-file-system` might provide this capability. I'm reconsidering the approach here—rather than trying to find native `appGroup` support in the MMKV library, I should leverage the App Group UserDefaults we've already set up and mirror the necessary settings there instead. This way the MMKV stays in the app's sandbox while keeping settings synchronized across the share extension through the shared UserDefaults.\n\nBut looking back at the plan, it actually calls for migrating MMKV itself to the App Group path using the `path` parameter, which should be a straightforward change in the storage configuration. Let me align with that documented approach rather than adding a sync layer.\n\nThe challenge is that I need to resolve the App Group container path at runtime on iOS, which requires a native module to expose it. I could add this to the existing WhisperKitModule, create a separate utility module, or use an Expo package to handle it.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture though, for Phase 7A I should probably defer the full App Group migration and instead write settings that the keyboard extension needs to UserDefaults via a sync helper, then tackle the complete sync mechanism in later phases. Let me first check if react-native-mmkv v4 has built-in App Group support that would simplify this.","signature":"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

But looking at the Podfile, the issue is that the `use_expo_modules!` call within the main target is looking for `WhisperKitModule` but can't find it by that name. The podspec file is named `WhisperKit.podspec` but the module name inside is `WhisperKitModule`.\n\nWait - let me re-read the error. The `pod install` error says: `[!] No podspec found for 'WhisperKitModule' in '../modules/whisperkit'`\n\n\nSo CocoaPods is looking for a podspec file named `WhisperKitModule.podspec` to match the module name declared in the `expo-module.config.json`, but the actual file is `WhisperKit.podspec`. The `use_expo_modules!` autolinking discovers the module via its config file and expects the podspec filename to match the declared module name. a Ruby/gem issue - it's specifically that CocoaPods can't find a podspec named `WhisperKitModule` in the whisperkit module directory, even though the file is named `WhisperKit.podspec`. The podspec name inside the file doesn't match what CocoaPods is looking for, or there's a mismatch between the pod name definition and the actual file structure. about cocoapods-spm. Let me think about this differently.\n\nActually, the error was: `No podspec found for 'WhisperKitModule' in '../modules/whisperkit'`\n\nThe issue is that the podspec is named `WhisperKit.podspec` but Expo autolinking expects it to match the spec name. Let me check - in the podspec, `s.name = 'WhisperKitModule'`. CocoaPods expects the filename to match the spec name.\n\nSo the fix is to rename `WhisperKit.podspec` to `WhisperKitModule.podspec`. But wait, this was working before in previous builds (Phases 1-5 were built successfully). What changed?\n\nActually, looking at the `link_native_modules!` output, it says the podspec path is pointing to `WhisperKit.podspec`. Maybe in previous versions, `use_expo_modules!` was passing the path directly, but with `@bacons/apple-targets` also in the mix, something might have changed.\n\nLet me try running `pod install` again with the right `GEM_PATH` that includes `cocoapods-spm`. The first error was about `cocoapods-spm` being undefined, which I fixed by installing the gem. Then the second error was about CocoaPods not finding the podspec during dependency resolution - it's looking for a spec named `WhisperKitModule` but can't locate it in the modules directory. pod called `WhisperKitModule` but can't find a matching podspec at the expected path.\n\nThe issue might be that CocoaPods can't find the file because the file is named `WhisperKit.podspec` but it's looking for `WhisperKitModule.podspec`.\n\nLet me try renaming the podspec to match the pod name.\n\nActually wait, I should not modify the existing whisperkit module since it was built in previous phases and was working. The issue might be that the previous `ios/` directory was already cached/built, and a `--clean` prebuild regenerated everything from scratch. The `pod install` then needs to resolve all dependencies fresh.\n\nLet me look at the actual error more carefully. The `link_native_modules!` output shows it found the whisperkit package with `podspec_path: \".../WhisperKit.podspec\"`.\n\nBut then `pod install` fails because it's looking for `WhisperKitModule.podspec` in the modules directory.

The iOS app will use WhisperKit for on-device speech-to-text (replacing whisper.cpp), Expo with development builds for the framework, and direct API calls for cloud transcription and AI reasoning providers.\n\nThe desktop app currently supports macOS, Windows, and Linux with features including local transcription (whisper.cpp, NVIDIA Parakeet), cloud transcription (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral), AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq), streaming transcription (Deepgram), transcription history (SQLite), custom dictionary, agent naming system, and clipboard auto-paste.\n\n### Project Directory Structure\n\n```\n/Users/weirenlan/Desktop/self_project/labs/openwhisper_mobile/   # <-- 工作區根目錄 (React Native iOS 新專案)\n├── reference/                # 原始 desktop Electron 專案的完整複本 (唯讀參考)\n│   ├── src/                  #   desktop 原始碼 (components, hooks, helpers, services, models, etc.)\n│   ├── main.js               #   Electron 主程序\n│   ├── preload.js            #   Electron preload\n│   ├── CLAUDE.md             #   Desktop 技術文件\n│   └── ...                   #   其他 desktop 檔案\n├── docs/plans/               # 計畫文件\n├── app/                      # (待建立) Expo Router screens\n├── src/                      # (待建立) React Native 原始碼\n├── modules/                  # (待建立) Expo native modules (WhisperKit)\n└── ...\n```\n\n**Important:**\n- `reference/` 是 desktop 專案的唯讀參考，**不要修改**其中的檔案\n- 實作時應參考 `reference/src/` 中的邏輯和模式，轉換為 React Native 等效實作\n- 可直接複製並適配的檔案：`reference/src/models/modelRegistryData.json`、`reference/src/utils/languages.ts`\n\n## Problem Statement / Motivation\n\nOpenWhispr is a desktop-only dictation app. Users want to dictate on their iPhones -- the most common device they carry. Mobile dictation enables:\n\n- Dictation on the go (commute, meetings, walking)\n- Always-available speech-to-text without a laptop\n- On-device privacy via WhisperKit (Apple Neural Engine optimized)\n- Seamless access to the same AI reasoning features as desktop\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nBuild a **separate React Native iOS app** using **Expo SDK 52+** with development builds. Use **WhisperKit** for local transcription (Core ML optimized for Apple Silicon), bridged via a custom **Expo Module** written in Swift. Reuse the model registry JSON and API integration patterns from the desktop app.\n\n### Technology Stack\n\n| Category | Desktop (Current) | iOS (Proposed) |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Framework** | Electron 36 + React 19 | React Native + Expo SDK 52+ |\n| **Local STT** | whisper.cpp binary | WhisperKit (Core ML, Neural Engine) |\n| **Audio Recording** | MediaRecorder API | expo-av (AVAudioRecorder) |\n| **Database** | better-sqlite3 | expo-sqlite + Drizzle ORM |\n| **Settings Storage** | localStorage | react-native-mmkv (sync, encrypted) |\n| **Secure Storage** | .env files | expo-secure-store (iOS Keychain) |\n| **State Management** | React Context + useSyncExternalStore | Zustand v5 |\n| **Clipboard** | AppleScript/PowerShell paste | expo-clipboard (copy only) |\n| **Routing** | URL-based (Electron windows) | expo-router v4 (file-based) |\n| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui | NativeWind (Tailwind for RN) |\n| **AI API Calls** | IPC bridge (CORS workaround) | Direct fetch (no CORS in RN) |\n| **Process Model** | Main + Renderer (IPC) | Single JS thread + Native Modules |\n| **Audio Format Conversion** | FFmpeg (bundled) | AVAudioSession (native format) |\n\n### Key Architecture Differences from Desktop\n\n1. **No IPC bridge** -- React Native communicates with native modules directly via JSI\n2. **No CORS** -- All API calls (including Anthropic) can be made directly from JS\n3. **WhisperKit replaces whisper.cpp** -- Core ML optimized, runs on Apple Neural Engine\n4. **No FFmpeg needed** -- expo-av handles audio format natively\n5. **Clipboard is simpler** -- No platform-specific automation, just expo-clipboard\n6. **Single window** -- Tab navigation replaces dual-window architecture\n7. **MMKV replaces localStorage** -- Synchronous, encrypted, faster\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nopenwhispr-mobile/\n├── app/

Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 1: Foundation (Project Setup + Audio Recording)\n\n**Goal:** Working React Native app that records audio on iOS and plays it back.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Initialize Expo project with SDK 52+ (`npx create-expo-app openwhispr-mobile --template tabs`)\n- [x] Configure app.json: bundle ID, iOS deployment target 17.0+, microphone permissions, background audio mode\n- [x] Install core dependencies: expo-av, expo-clipboard, expo-secure-store, expo-sqlite, react-native-mmkv, zustand, expo-router, nativewind\n- [x] Set up file-based routing with expo-router v4 (tab

\"0.9.0\",\n    :products => [\"WhisperKit\"]\n  ```\n- [x] Implement `WhisperKitModule.swift` with these bridged methods:\n  - `initialize(model: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Load WhisperKit with specified model\n  - `transcribe(audioPath: String, language: String?, prompt: String?) -> Promise<TranscriptionResult>` -- Transcribe audio file\n  - `downloadModel(name: String) -> Void` (with progress events) -- Download model from HuggingFace\n  - `deleteModel(name: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Delete downloaded model\n  - `getAvailableModels() -> Promise<[ModelInfo]>` -- List available models with sizes\n  - `getDownloadedModels() -> Promise<[String]>` -- List downloaded models\n  - `isModelDownloaded(name: String) -> Promise<Bool>` -- Check if model exists\n  - `getRecommendedModel() -> Promise<String>` -- WhisperKit's device-specific recommendation\n- [x] Implement model download with progress events (emit events from Swift to JS)\n- [x] Implement disk space check before model download\n- [ ] Handle cellular vs WiFi download policy (warn for downloads >100MB on cellular)\n- [x] Implement `useWhisperKit.ts` hook wrapping the native module\n- [x]

devices\n\n**Deliverables:** Record audio -> transcribe locally with WhisperKit -> display text.\n\n#### Phase 3: Cloud Transcription + AI Reasoning\n\n**Goal:** Cloud transcription (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral) and AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Implement `CloudTranscription.ts` service:\n  - OpenAI `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart/form-data upload)\n  - Groq `/v1/audio/transcriptions`\n  - Mistral (no CORS issues in RN, call directly)\n  - Support custom base URL for self-hosted endpoints\n- [x] Implement AI reasoning services (all direct fetch, no IPC needed):\n  - `OpenAIService.ts` -- Responses API (`/v1/responses`) with Chat Completions fallback\n  - `AnthropicService.ts` -- Messages API (`/v1/messages`) -- direct call (no CORS in RN)\n  - `GeminiService.ts` -- generateContent API\n  - `GroqService.ts` -- Chat Completions API\n- [x] Implement `ReasoningService.ts` -- agent detection + provider routing:\n  - Detect \"Hey [AgentName]\"

agent name)\n\n**Deliverables:** Full transcription pipeline working (local + cloud + AI enhancement).\n\n#### Phase 4: Data Layer + History\n\n**Goal:** SQLite database for transcription history, settings persistence.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Set up expo-sqlite with schema and migrations\n- [x] Define schema:\n  ```sql\n  CREATE TABLE transcriptions (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    text TEXT NOT NULL,\n    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    duration INTEGER,           -- recording duration in ms\n    model_used TEXT,            -- which model transcribed this\n    is_local INTEGER DEFAULT 1, -- local vs cloud transcription\n    was_processed INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- AI reasoning applied\n    processing_method TEXT\n  );\n\n  CREATE TABLE custom_dictionary (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    word TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n  );\n  ```\n- [x] Implement database migrations (via expo-sqlite sync API)\n-

[x] Implement `appStore.ts` (Zustand) for recording/transcribing state\n\n**Deliverables:** Transcription history with search, custom dictionary management.\n\n#### Phase 5: Settings + Onboarding + Polish\n\n**Goal:** Complete settings interface, onboarding flow, and production polish.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [x] Build settings hub with sections:\n  - **Transcription:** Engine selection (local/cloud), model picker, language\n  - **AI Models:** Reasoning provider, model selection, agent name\n  - **Dictionary:** Custom word management\n  - **API Keys:** Per-provider key management (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq)\n  - **Appearance:** Theme (light/dark/auto)\n  - **Privacy:** Telemetry toggle\n  - **Account:** Sign in/out, usage, billing (if OpenWhispr cloud)\n  - **About:** App version, licenses\n- [x] Build onboarding flow (5 screens):\n  1. Welcome + optional auth\n  2. Microphone permission request\n  3. Transcription setup (local/cloud + model download)\n  4. Agent naming\n  5. Setup complete\n- [x] Implement theme system (light/dark/auto) with NativeWind\n- [x] Add haptic feedback (expo-haptics) for record start/stop and transcription complete\n- [ ] Add audio cues for dictation start/stop (port sound files from desktop)\n- [x] Implement copy-to-clipboard for transcription results\n- [x] Implement iOS Share Sheet for transcription text\n- [ ] Handle edge cases:\n  - Audio interruptions (phone calls, Siri)\n  - Background app transitions during recording\n  - Low memory warnings during WhisperKit processing\n  - Network errors during cloud transcription\n  - Model download failures (resume, retry)\n  - Permission revocation (mic)\n  - Low battery / Low Power Mode warnings\n- [ ] Implement VoiceOver accessibility for all screens\n- [ ] Configure app icons and splash screen\n- [ ] Set up EAS Build for TestFlight distribution\n\n**Deliverables:** Production-ready app with complete UI, onboarding, and error handling.\n\n#### Phase 6: Authentication + Cloud Features (Optional for v1)\n\n**Goal:** OpenWhispr cloud integration for signed-in users.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement Neon Auth via expo-auth-session or expo-web-browser\n- [ ] Implement OpenWhispr cloud transcription (POST to `/api/transcribe`)\n- [ ] Implement OpenWhispr cloud reasoning (POST to `/api/reason`)\n- [ ] Implement usage tracking and limit warnings\n- [ ] Implement billing/upgrade flows (Stripe checkout via in-app browser)\n- [ ] Implement cloud backup for transcriptions (if enabled)\n\n**Deliverables:** Full cloud feature parity with desktop for signed-in users.\n\n## Alternative Approaches Considered\n\n### 1. whisper.rn (whisper.cpp binding) instead of WhisperKit\n\n**Pros:** Cross-platform (iOS + Android), same model format as desktop (GGML), mature library\n**Cons:** Not optimized for Apple Neural Engine, slower than WhisperKit on iOS, no Core ML acceleration\n**Decision:** Rejected. WhisperKit provides significantly better performance on iOS via Core ML and Neural Engine optimization. The user specifically requested WhisperKit.\n\n### 2. whisper-kit-expo (existing npm package) instead of custom Expo Module\n\n**Pros:** Ready-made, less native code to write\n**Cons:** Limited API surface (only `transcribe()` and `loadTranscriber()`), no model management APIs, unclear maintenance status, no streaming support, no progress events for model downloads\n**Decision:** Rejected for primary integration. May reference its cocoapods-spm setup pattern. Building a custom Expo Module gives full control over the WhisperKit API surface.\n\n### 3. Swift + SwiftUI instead of React Native\n\n**Pros:** Best iOS performance, native WhisperKit integration (no bridge), full platform API access\n**Cons:** No code sharing with desktop React codebase, new language for the team, longer development time for full feature set\n**Decision:** Rejected per user preference for React Native.\n\n### 4. Bare React Native (no Expo)\n\n**Pros:** Full native control from day one\n**Cons:** More complex build setup, manual native module linking, no OTA updates, harder upgrades\n**Decision:** Rejected. Expo SDK 52+ with development builds provides full native access while offering better DX (expo-router, config plugins, EAS Build).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe locally using WhisperKit on-device\n- [ ] User can record audio and transcribe via cloud providers (OpenAI, Groq, Mistral)\n- [ ] User can configure and use AI text enhancement (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq)\n- [ ] User can name their agent and trigger AI processing with \"Hey [AgentName]\"\n- [ ] User can view, search, copy, share, and delete transcription history\n- [ ] User can manage custom dictionary words\n- [ ] User can download, select, and delete WhisperKit models\n- [ ] User can securely store and manage API keys for all providers\n- [ ] User can select from 58+ transcription languages\n- [ ] User completes onboarding flow on first launch\n- [ ] App works offline for local transcription (model pre-downloaded)\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- [ ] iOS deployment target: 17.0+\n- [ ] WhisperKit transcription completes in <5s for 30s audio on iPhone 14+\n- [ ] App launch to record-ready in <2s (model pre-loaded)\n- [ ] Memory usage stays under 1.5GB during transcription\n- [ ] API keys stored in iOS Keychain (not plain storage)\n- [ ] Audio recording at 16kHz mono WAV for WhisperKit compatibility\n- [ ] Microphone permission handled gracefully (request, denial, revocation)\n- [ ] VoiceOver accessible on all screens\n\n### Quality Gates\n\n- [ ] Tested on physical devices: iPhone 12, iPhone 14, iPhone 16 (minimum 3 generations)\n- [ ] All screens pass VoiceOver audit\n- [ ] No memory leaks during extended recording sessions\n- [ ] App Store review requirements met (privacy policy, usage descriptions)\n\n## Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n1. **Apple Developer Account** -- Required for physical device testing and App Store submission\n2. **WhisperKit v0.9+** -- Swift Package, MIT license\n3. **Expo SDK 52+** -- Framework with development builds\n4. **Physical iOS device** -- WhisperKit requires Neural Engine (Simulator insufficient for testing)\n5. **OpenWhispr cloud backend** -- For auth, cloud transcription, billing (if Phase 6 included)\n\n## Risk Analysis & Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| WhisperKit Expo Module bridging complexity | Medium | High | Start with proof-of-concept in Phase 2; reference whisper-kit-expo's cocoapods-spm pattern |\n| Large model downloads fail on mobile networks | Medium | Medium | Implement resume/retry, cellular warnings, disk space checks, background URLSession downloads |\n| Memory pressure with large WhisperKit models | Medium | High | Filter models by device capability, implement memory monitoring, fallback to smaller model |\n| iOS background audio restrictions | Low | Medium | Use UIBackgroundModes audio, test extensively, document limitations |\n| App Store rejection (audio recording app) | Low | High | Include comprehensive privacy policy, proper NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, no unnecessary permissions |\n| WhisperKit API breaking changes | Low | Medium | Pin to specific version, test during upgrades |\n\n## Deferred to Future Versions\n\nThese features from the desktop app or iOS-specific enhancements are **not included in v1**:\n\n| Feature | Reason for Deferral |\n|---------|-------------------|\n| **Streaming transcription (Deepgram/AssemblyAI)** | Adds significant complexity; batch transcription covers core use case |\n| **Local LLM reasoning (llama.cpp)** | Resource-intensive on mobile; cloud reasoning available |\n| **NVIDIA Parakeet (sherpa-onnx)** | iOS-only app; WhisperKit provides superior iOS transcription |\n| **Keyboard extension** | Separate Xcode target; complex shared storage; v2 feature |\n| **Siri Shortcuts** | Nice-to-have; not core functionality |\n| **Live Activities / Dynamic Island** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n| **iOS Widget** | Requires Widget Extension; v2 enhancement |\n| **Cross-platform data sync** | Requires backend changes; desktop and mobile are separate projects |\n| **iPad-optimized layout** | Universal app runs on iPad; dedicated layout is v2 |\n\n## Text Output Strategy (Critical UX Decision)\n\nThe desktop app's core value is auto-paste: record speech and it appears in whatever app you were using. **iOS sandboxing prevents this.**\n\n### v1 Approach: Copy + Share\n\n1. After transcription, text is displayed on screen\n2. **Copy button** -- copies text to iOS clipboard (one tap)\n3. **Share button** -- opens iOS Share Sheet (send to any app: Messages, Notes, Mail, etc.)\n4. **Auto-copy setting** -- optionally auto-copy to clipboard after every transcription\n\n### v2 Approach: Custom Keyboard Extension\n\nA keyboard extension would allow voice dictation directly within any text field in any app -- the closest analog to the desktop's auto-paste. This is the most impactful iOS-specific feature but requires a separate Xcode target and shared App Group storage.\n\n---\n\n## v2 Feature Plan: Custom Keyboard Extension\n\n### Overview\n\nBuild an iOS Custom Keyboard Extension that enables voice-to-text dictation directly within any text field in any app. The user switches to the OpenWhispr keyboard, taps a microphone button, speaks, and the transcribed text is inserted at the cursor position -- replicating the desktop app's auto-paste UX within iOS sandboxing constraints.\n\n### Critical Constraint: No Microphone in Keyboard Extensions\n\n**iOS keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone.** This is an Apple restriction since iOS 8, unchanged through iOS 18/26. Even with `RequestsOpenAccess = true` and Full Access granted, `AVAudioSession`/`AVAudioRecorder` calls fail with error `561145187` from the keyboard extension process.\n\n**Every shipping voice keyboard** (Wispr Flow, Willow, Spokenly) works around this by recording audio in the main app process and communicating results back to the keyboard extension via App Groups.\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│              Main App (Expo/RN)                  │\n│                                                  │\n│  [Existing UI] [Settings] [Model Manager]        │\n│                                                  │\n│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │\n│  │  BackgroundDictationService (NEW)          │  │\n│  │  - AVAudioSession (background mode)        │  │\n│  │  - Audio recording                         │  │\n│  │  - WhisperKit transcription                │  │\n│  │  - Cloud transcription fallback            │  │\n│  │  - AI reasoning pipeline                   │  │\n│  │  - Writes result → App Group               │  │\n│  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │\n│                                                  │\n│  Storage: App Group UserDefaults + File Container│\n│  Keychain: Shared access group for API keys      │\n└──────────────┬───────────────────▲───────────────┘\n               │ URL scheme        │ App Group\n               │ deep link         │ shared data\n               ▼                   │\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│        Keyboard Extension (Native Swift)         │\n│                                                  │\n│  [SwiftUI UI: mic button + status + globe key]   │\n│  [UITextDocumentProxy: text insertion]            │\n│  [App Group reader: settings, transcriptions]     │\n│  [URL scheme launcher: opens main app]            │\n│  [Darwin notification observer: real-time IPC]    │\n│                                                  │\n│  Memory budget: ~8-15 MB / ~48-70 MB limit       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Key Technical Decisions\n\n| Decision | Choice | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **Extension UI framework** | Native Swift + SwiftUI | React Native runtime (~30-40 MB) exceeds extension memory budget (~48-70 MB). RN team closed this as \"not planned\" ([#31910](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)). |\n| **Xcode target setup** | `@bacons/apple-targets` | Supports `keyboard` type natively, auto-mirrors App Group entitlements, shared code via `targets/_shared/`, active maintenance. Requires Expo SDK 53+. |\n| **Data sharing** | App Group UserDefaults + shared file container | Standard iOS pattern for app-to-extension communication. `group.com.openwhispr.mobile` identifier. |\n| **IPC mechanism** | Darwin notifications + App Group polling | `CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter` for real-time signals (recording start/stop), App Group UserDefaults polling (0.5s) for state/text transfer. More responsive than polling alone. |\n| **Settings sharing** | Migrate MMKV to App Group path | MMKV supports custom directory via `path` parameter. One-line change in `src/storage/mmkv.ts`. No existing user base to migrate. |\n| **API key sharing** | Shared Keychain access group | Add `keychain-access-groups` entitlement to both targets. `expo-secure-store` may need native override. |\n| **WhisperKit location** | Main app only | Models require ~75MB+ memory at runtime. Extension memory limit makes in-extension inference impossible. |\n| **Keyboard type** | Dictation-only (no QWERTY) | Full keyboard replacement is massive scope. Competitors (Willow) also use dictation-only approach. Users switch keyboards for typing. |\n| **Recording flow** | Hybrid: background audio session + deep link fallback | First activation deep-links to main app to start background audio session. Subsequent dictations signal via Darwin notification without app switching. Falls back to deep link if session expires. |\n| **Open Access** | `RequestsOpenAccess = true` | Required for App Group access, network (cloud transcription), and clipboard. Keyboard must also work in degraded mode without Full Access (shows setup instructions). |\n\n### Communication Protocol\n\nThe keyboard extension and main app communicate via a structured JSON state machine in App Group UserDefaults:\n\n```swift\n// Key: \"com.openwhispr.dictation_state\"\nstruct DictationState: Codable {\n    let sessionId: String        // UUID per dictation\n    let state: DictationPhase    // idle | start_requested | recording | transcribing | complete | error\n    let text: String?            // Transcription result (when complete)\n    let error: String?           // Error message (when error)\n    let timestamp: TimeInterval  // For staleness detection\n}\n\nenum DictationPhase: String, Codable {\n    case idle\n    case startRequested = \"start_requested\"\n    case recording\n    case transcribing\n    case complete\n    case error\n}\n```\n\n**State transitions:**\n```\nKeyboard                          Main App\n   │                                 │\n   ├── write(startRequested) ──────> │\n   │   + Darwin notify               │\n   │                                 ├── read startRequested\n   │                                 ├── start AVAudioSession\n   │                                 ├── write(recording)\n   │ <── observe recording ──────────┤\n   │   (show recording UI)           │\n   │                                 │   ... user speaks ...\n   │                                 │\n   ├── write(startRequested.stop) ─> │  (or auto-stop on silence)\n   │                                 ├── stop recording\n   │                                 ├── write(transcribing)\n   │ <── observe transcribing ───────┤\n   │   (show spinner)                │\n   │                                 ├── run WhisperKit / cloud\n   │                                 ├── run AI reasoning (optional)\n   │                                 ├── write(complete, text: \"...\")\n   │ <── observe complete ───────────┤\n   │   insert text via proxy         │\n   │   write(idle)                   │\n   └─────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Race condition protection:** Each dictation uses a UUID `sessionId`. The keyboard only reads results matching its current session. Stale states (timestamp > 60s) are treated as `idle`.\n\n### User Flows\n\n**Flow A: First-time keyboard setup**\n1. User completes main app onboarding\n2. Onboarding step 6 (NEW): \"Set Up Keyboard\" with visual instructions\n3. User goes to iOS Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > OpenWhispr Voice\n4. User taps OpenWhispr Voice > enables \"Allow Full Access\"\n5. User confirms Apple's Full Access warning dialog\n\n**Flow B: First dictation per session (deep link)**\n1. User is in any app (Messages, Notes, etc.) with OpenWhispr keyboard active\n2. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n3. Keyboard writes `startRequested` + opens `openwhispr://dictate?session=<uuid>`\n4. iOS switches to OpenWhispr main app\n5. Main app starts background audio session + begins recording\n6. User speaks, taps \"Done\" (or silence auto-stop after 3s / max 5 min)\n7. Main app transcribes, writes `complete` + text to App Group\n8. User taps \"Return\" button or swipes back to source app\n9. Keyboard detects `complete`, inserts text via `textDocumentProxy.insertText()`\n\n**Flow C: Subsequent dictation (background session active)**\n1. User taps microphone button in keyboard\n2. Keyboard checks `backgroundSessionActive` flag in App Group\n3. Flag is true → keyboard writes `startRequested` + sends Darwin notification\n4. Main app (background) starts recording — yellow mic indicator in Dynamic Island\n5. User speaks, taps stop in keyboard\n6. Main app transcribes, writes result to App Group\n7. Keyboard inserts text — **no app switching required**\n\n**Flow D: Full Access not enabled**\n1. User switches to OpenWhispr keyboard\n2. Keyboard checks `self.hasFullAccess` → false\n3. Keyboard shows message: \"Enable Full Access to use voice dictation\" with instructions\n4. Globe/Next Keyboard button still works for switching away\n\n**Flow E: No model downloaded (local mode)**\n1. User taps dictate in keyboard\n2. Keyboard opens main app via deep link\n3. Main app detects no WhisperKit model → shows download prompt\n4. User downloads model, returns to source app, tries again\n\n### Implementation Phases\n\n#### Phase 7A: Infrastructure & App Group Setup\n\n**Goal:** Migrate shared storage to App Group, configure Xcode targets, establish IPC foundation.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Add App Group entitlement (`group.com.openwhispr.mobile`) to main app via `app.json` `ios.entitlements`\n- [ ] Install `@bacons/apple-targets` (`npx expo install @bacons/apple-targets`)\n- [ ] Create `targets/keyboard/` directory structure:\n  ```\n  targets/\n    keyboard/\n      expo-target.config.js    # type: \"keyboard\", entitlements, deployment target\n      Info.plist               # NSExtension config, RequestsOpenAccess, PrimaryLanguage\n      KeyboardViewController.swift  # Minimal UIInputViewController stub\n    _shared/\n      AppGroupStorage.swift    # Shared UserDefaults + file container helpers\n      DictationState.swift     # State machine types (DictationState, DictationPhase)\n      Constants.swift          # App Group ID, Darwin notification names, keys\n  ```\n- [ ] Migrate MMKV storage to App Group container path in `src/storage/mmkv.ts`:\n  ```typescript\n  // Use expo-file-system to resolve App Group path, pass to MMKV\n  export const storage = createMMKV({\n    id: \"openwhispr-settings\",\n    path: \"<app-group-container>/mmkv\",\n  });\n  ```\n- [ ] Add shared Keychain access group entitlement for API key sharing\n- [ ] Configure `app.json` `extra.eas.build.experimental.ios.appExtensions` for EAS credential management\n- [ ] Add `openwhispr://dictate` deep link handler in expo-router (new `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` or handle in `_layout.tsx`)\n- [ ] Create `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` stub (coordinates recording → transcription → App Group write)\n- [ ] Run `npx expo prebuild --clean` and verify two Xcode targets exist\n- [ ] Verify App Group entitlements in both targets' `.entitlements` files\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `targets/keyboard/expo-target.config.js` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Info.plist` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` (NEW — stub)\n- `targets/_shared/AppGroupStorage.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/_shared/DictationState.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/_shared/Constants.swift` (NEW)\n- `src/storage/mmkv.ts` (MODIFY — App Group path)\n- `src/storage/secureStorage.ts` (MODIFY — shared Keychain access group)\n- `app.json` (MODIFY — entitlements, appExtensions)\n- `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` (NEW — deep link handler)\n- `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` (NEW — stub)\n\n#### Phase 7B: Keyboard Extension UI (Native Swift)\n\n**Goal:** Build the keyboard extension UI in SwiftUI with all states, Full Access detection, and text insertion.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement `KeyboardViewController.swift` with SwiftUI hosting:\n  - Microphone button (large, centered) with tap and long-press\n  - \"Next Keyboard\" globe button (Apple requirement — `advanceToNextInputMode()`)\n  - Status indicator: idle / recording (pulsing) / transcribing (spinner) / done (checkmark) / error (message)\n  - Full Access detection (`hasFullAccess` check with setup guidance view)\n  - Dark mode support via `traitCollection.userInterfaceStyle`\n  - Haptic feedback on button taps (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`)\n- [ ] Implement App Group state observer:\n  - 0.5s polling timer for `DictationState` changes in App Group UserDefaults\n  - Darwin notification observer for real-time signals (`CFNotificationCenterGetDarwinNotifyCenter`)\n  - Session ID matching to prevent stale result insertion\n- [ ] Implement text insertion via `UITextDocumentProxy`:\n  - Smart whitespace: check `documentContextBeforeInput` — prepend space if last char isn't space/newline\n  - Handle long text (insert in one call — `insertText()` handles this correctly)\n- [ ] Implement URL scheme launcher:\n  - `UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"openwhispr://dictate?session=\\(sessionId)\")!)`\n  - Detect whether to deep-link (first use / session expired) or signal via Darwin notification (session active)\n- [ ] Configure keyboard height via Auto Layout constraints (~200pt for dictation-only)\n- [ ] Build and test on physical device (keyboard extensions don't work in simulator)\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `targets/keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/DictationButton.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/StatusView.swift` (NEW)\n- `targets/keyboard/Views/FullAccessGuide.swift` (NEW)\n\n#### Phase 7C: Background Dictation Service (Main App)\n\n**Goal:** Implement the main app's background recording + transcription pipeline triggered by the keyboard extension.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Implement `BackgroundDictationService.ts` (or native Swift service):\n  - Observe `DictationState.startRequested` in App Group (polling + Darwin notification)\n  - Start `AVAudioSession` with `.playAndRecord` category and `.defaultToSpeaker` option\n  - Configure background audio mode in `app.json`: `\"UIBackgroundModes\": [\"audio\"]`\n  - Record audio using `expo-av` Recording API (16kHz mono WAV)\n  - Implement silence detection: auto-stop after 3s below -40dB threshold\n  - Implement max duration: auto-stop after 5 minutes\n  - After recording stops: route through existing transcription pipeline (`useTranscription` logic)\n  - Write `DictationState.complete` with transcribed text to App Group\n  - Write `DictationState.error` with message on failure\n  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = true` flag in App Group\n  - Heartbeat: update `backgroundSessionLastPing` timestamp every 30s while session is alive\n- [ ] Implement deep link handler in `app/dictate-bridge.tsx`:\n  - Parse `session` parameter from URL\n  - Start `BackgroundDictationService` with session ID\n  - Show minimal recording UI (waveform + \"Done\" button + \"Return to app\" button)\n  - After transcription complete: show \"Text ready — return to your app\" message\n- [ ] Handle audio interruptions (phone call, Siri):\n  - Stop recording, transcribe partial audio if > 1s\n  - Write partial result with `wasPartial: true` flag\n- [ ] Handle app termination:\n  - Set `backgroundSessionActive = false` on `applicationWillTerminate`\n  - Keyboard extension detects expired session, falls back to deep link\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `src/services/BackgroundDictationService.ts` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `app/dictate-bridge.tsx` (IMPLEMENT)\n- `app.json` (MODIFY — `UIBackgroundModes: [\"audio\"]`)\n- `src/hooks/useAudioRecording.ts` (MODIFY — add silence detection, max duration)\n\n#### Phase 7D: Settings Sync & Onboarding Integration\n\n**Goal:** Ensure settings, onboarding, and keyboard setup are fully integrated.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Verify MMKV reads/writes work from both main app and keyboard extension (App Group path)\n- [ ] Add onboarding step 6: \"Set Up Keyboard\" (between Agent Naming and Complete):\n  - Visual instructions with iOS Settings screenshots\n  - Steps: Settings > General > Keyboards > Add New > OpenWhispr Voice > Allow Full Access\n  - \"Skip for now\" option (keyboard setup can be done later from Settings)\n- [ ] Add \"Keyboard Setup\" section to Settings screen (`app/(tabs)/settings.tsx`):\n  - Detect if keyboard is installed (no reliable API — show setup instructions always)\n  - Link to iOS keyboard settings (`UIApplication.shared.open(URL(string: \"App-prefs:General&path=Keyboard\")!)`)\n  - Full Access status check and guidance\n- [ ] Update transcription database schema: add `source` column (`\"app\"` | `\"keyboard\"`)\n- [ ] Update `transcriptionStore.ts` to include `source` field\n- [ ] Update history screen to show source badge (app vs keyboard)\n- [ ] Mirror custom dictionary from MMKV to App Group UserDefaults for keyboard access\n- [ ] Test settings changes propagation: change language in main app → keyboard uses new language on next dictation\n\n**Files to create/modify:**\n- `app/onboarding.tsx` (MODIFY — add keyboard setup step, TOTAL_STEPS = 6)\n- `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` (MODIFY — add Keyboard Setup section)\n- `src/storage/database.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` column migration)\n- `src/stores/transcriptionStore.ts` (MODIFY — add `source` field)\n- `app/(tabs)/history.tsx` (MODIFY — source badge)\n\n#### Phase 7E: Testing, Polish & Edge Cases\n\n**Goal:** Comprehensive testing on physical devices, edge case handling, App Store readiness.\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Test on physical iPhone (keyboard extensions don't work in simulator)\n- [ ] Test first-time flow: install → onboard → add keyboard → enable Full Access → dictate\n- [ ] Test repeated dictation: dictate → insert → dictate again → insert (no stale results)\n- [ ] Test background session flow: deep-link once → subsequent dictations without app switching\n- [ ] Test background session expiration: force-kill main app → keyboard falls back to deep link\n- [ ] Test cloud transcription from keyboard (requires network + API key)\n- [ ] Test AI reasoning from keyboard (agent name detection + cleanup)\n- [ ] Test offline + local mode (WhisperKit only, no network needed)\n- [ ] Test offline + cloud mode (should show clear error in keyboard)\n- [ ] Test audio interruption: phone call during recording → partial transcription\n- [ ] Test secure text fields: iOS replaces custom keyboard → no action needed\n- [ ] Test Full Access not granted: degraded mode shows setup instructions\n- [ ] Test memory usage: keyboard extension stays under 30 MB (profile with Instruments)\n- [ ] Test iPad: keyboard appears and functions correctly\n- [ ] Test Dark Mode in keyboard extension\n- [ ] Test VoiceOver accessibility in keyboard extension\n- [ ] Add privacy policy explaining Full Access data usage (required for App Review)\n- [ ] Test EAS Build with extension target included\n- [ ] Test TestFlight distribution with keyboard extension\n\n**Deliverables:** Production-ready keyboard extension with robust error handling and all edge cases covered.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n\n#### Functional Requirements\n- [ ] User can add OpenWhispr keyboard from iOS Settings\n- [ ] User can enable Full Access for the keyboard\n- [ ] User can switch to OpenWhispr keyboard in any text field\n- [ ] Tapping dictation button triggers recording (via main app)\n- [ ] Transcribed text is inserted at cursor position in the host app\n- [ ] Smart whitespace insertion (prepend space when needed)\n- [ ] Background session flow works without app switching (after first activation)\n- [ ] Settings (language, model, local/cloud) are shared between app and extension\n- [ ] API keys are accessible to main app from keyboard-triggered dictation\n- [ ] Custom dictionary is applied to keyboard-triggered transcriptions\n- [ ] AI reasoning works for keyboard-triggered dictations\n- [ ] Transcription history records keyboard-originated entries with `source: \"keyboard\"`\n- [ ] Keyboard shows clear status: idle, recording, transcribing, done, error\n- [ ] Keyboard shows setup guidance when Full Access is not enabled\n- [ ] Keyboard supports Dark Mode\n\n#### Non-Functional Requirements\n- [ ] Keyboard extension memory usage < 30 MB\n- [ ] Keyboard appears in < 200ms (no React Native runtime)\n- [ ] Text insertion latency < 100ms after transcription complete\n- [ ] Background audio session survives app backgrounding for at least 10 minutes\n- [ ] Graceful degradation on audio interruption (partial transcription)\n\n### Dependencies & Prerequisites\n\n| Dependency | Status | Notes

guide, FAQs |\n\n### Future Enhancements (Post-v2)\n\n- **Apple SpeechAnalyzer (iOS 26+):** System-managed on-device speech recognition with zero app memory overhead. [Argmax is integrating with WhisperKit](https://www.argmaxinc.com/blog/apple-and-argmax). Could enable in-extension transcription.\n- **Full QWERTY keyboard layout:** Add typing capability alongside dictation. Consider [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) open-source library.\n- **Siri Shortcuts integration:** Trigger dictation via Action Button or Back Tap without opening the keyboard.\n- **Live Activities / Dynamic Island:** Show recording status in Dynamic Island while recording in background.\n- **Streaming transcription:** Use Deepgram/AssemblyAI for real-time word-by-word insertion as user speaks.\n- **Clipboard-based fallback (Spokenly pattern):** For users who don't want a custom keyboard — dictate in app, auto-copy to clipboard.\n\n### References\n\n#### Apple Documentation\n- [Custom Keyboard Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html)\n- [Creating a Custom Keyboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/creating-a-custom-keyboard)\n- [Configuring Open Access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/configuring-open-access-for-a-custom-keyboard)\n- [UITextDocumentProxy](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextdocumentproxy)\n- [SpeechAnalyzer (iOS 26)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/speechanalyzer)\n\n#### Packages & Libraries\n- [@bacons/apple-targets](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets) — Expo plugin for adding Apple extension targets\n- [expo-keyboard-extension](https://github.com/cmaycumber/expo-keyboard-extension) — React Native keyboard extension (reference only)\n- [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) — Open-source Swift keyboard framework\n\n#### Competitor Analysis\n- [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai) — \"Flow Session\" background audio pattern\n- [Willow Voice](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/willows-voice-keyboard-lets-you-type-across-all-your-ios-apps-and-actually-edit-what-you-said/) — App-switch pattern (YC W25)\n- [Spokenly](https://spokenly.app/docs/ios/clipboard-dictation) — Shortcuts + clipboard pattern (on-device WhisperKit)\n\n#### Technical References\n- [React Native Keyboard Extension Memory Issue #31910](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/31910)\n- [Argmax: Apple SpeechAnalyzer + WhisperKit](https://www.argmaxinc.com/blog/apple-and-argmax)\n- [iOS App Extensions Data Sharing](https://dmtopolog.com/ios-app-extensions-data-sharing/)\n- [Expo iOS App Extensions Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/app-extensions/)\n\n### How to Invoke\n\n```bash\n# Phase 7A: Infrastructure\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7A: App Group setup, @bacons/apple-targets, MMKV migration, keyboard target scaffold\"\n\n# Phase 7B: Keyboard UI\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7B: Native Swift keyboard extension UI with dictation button, status, text insertion\"\n\n# Phase 7C: Background Dictation\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7C: BackgroundDictationService, deep link handler, audio recording, transcription pipeline\"\n\n# Phase 7D: Settings & Onboarding\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7D: Settings sync, onboarding keyboard step, database source column, history badges\"\n\n# Phase 7E: Testing & Polish\n/workflows:work docs/plans/2026-02-12-feat-ios-react-native-port-plan.md \"Implement Phase 7E: Physical device testing, edge cases, memory profiling, App Store readiness\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Development Skills Reference\n\nDuring implementation, developers **must** consult the following skills in `.agents/skills/` for best practices and conventions:\n\n| Skill | Path | When to Use |\n|-------|------|-------------|\n| **Vercel React Native Skills** | `.agents/skills/vercel-react-native-skills/` | All React Native development: component patterns, performance optimization (FlashList/LegendList), animation (Reanimated), state management (Zustand), styling conventions, expo-image, native module integration, React Compiler compatibility |\n| **Vercel React Best Practices** | `.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/` | General React patterns: hooks, context, rendering optimization, code splitting, error boundaries, data fetching patterns |\n| **Vercel Composition Patterns** | `.agents/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/` | Component architecture: avoiding boolean prop proliferation, building flexible/composable components, slot patterns, compound components, render delegation |\n| **Web Design Guidelines** | `.agents/skills/web-design-guidelines/` | UI/UX review: accessibility compliance, interaction patterns, visual design consistency |\n| **UI/UX Pro Max** | `/ui-ux-pro-max` skill | Overall UI/UX experience optimization: 50 design styles, 21 color palettes, 50 font pairings, chart patterns, and multi-framework stacks. Use for polishing the mobile interface, ensuring visual consistency, and elevating the design quality. **The desktop app's existing UI should be used as the design reference** -- adapt its visual language (colors, typography, component styles) to iOS mobile conventions. |\n| **Workflows: Review** | `/workflows:review` skill | **Mandatory after completing each phase.** Run a multi-agent exhaustive code review after each implementation phase (Phase 1-6) is complete.

integrity, IPC race conditions, background session lifecycle, Full Access UX |\n\n### Design Reference: Desktop App\n\nThe iOS app's interface design should reference the existing desktop app (`reference/src/components/`) as the baseline:\n\n- **Color scheme and branding** -- match the desktop app's theme (light/dark modes, accent colors)\n- **Component patterns** -- adapt desktop's shadcn/ui component style to React Native equivalents\n- **Layout hierarchy** -- translate the desktop Control Panel layout to mobile tab navigation\n- **Recording UX** -- the floating record button concept can translate to a prominent centered button on the dictation tab\n- **Settings organization** -- follow the desktop's settings grouping (Profile, App, Speech, Intelligence, System)\n- **Typography and spacing** -- maintain the same visual rhythm, adjusted for mobile touch targets (minimum 44pt)\n\n### Key Conventions from Skills\n\n- **Use `Pressable` over `TouchableOpacity`** -- better accessibility and hover support\n- **Use `expo-image` over `Image`** -- built-in caching, blurhash placeholders\n- **Use `borderCurve: 'continuous'` for rounded corners** -- iOS-native squircle look\n- **Use `gap` for spacing** instead of margin on children\n- **Wrap third-party components** in `src/components/ui/` for easy replacement\n- **Zustand with selectors** for global state (prevents unnecessary re-renders)\n- **Never use `inline styles` in list items** -- extract to `StyleSheet.create()`\n- **Use `LegendList` or `FlashList`** instead of `FlatList` for large lists\n\n## References

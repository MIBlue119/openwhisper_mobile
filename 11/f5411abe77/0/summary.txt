The changes look good. Here's what was done and what you need to know:

**Root cause:** `requireNativeModule("WhisperKitModule")` in `modules/whisperkit/src/index.ts:66` throws an uncaught error at import time when the native module isn't compiled into the binary. This crashes the entire app on startup.

**What I fixed:**
1. **`modules/whisperkit/src/index.ts`** — Changed `requireNativeModule` to `requireOptionalNativeModule` (returns `null` instead of throwing). Added a `getNativeModule()` helper that throws a descriptive error only when you actually try to *use* the module, and an `isAvailable()` check.

2. **`src/hooks/useWhisperKit.ts`** — Added `isAvailable()` guards so the hook gracefully sets an error message instead of crashing when the native module isn't linked.

**To actually get WhisperKit working**, you need to rebuild the native app (not just restart Metro):

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

If you were running `expo start` (Metro only), the native binary from a previous build won't include the WhisperKitModule. `expo run:ios` triggers a full native build that compiles and links the Swift module.
